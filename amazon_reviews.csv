2,"Stuning even for the non-gamer: This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^"
2,"The best soundtrack ever to anything.: I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."
2,"Amazing!: This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars."
2,"Excellent Soundtrack: I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross"
2,"Remember, Pull Your Jaw Off The Floor After Hearing it: If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper."
2,"an absolute masterpiece: I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"
1,"Buyer beware: This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
2,"Glorious story: I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story."
2,"A FIVE STAR BOOK: I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!"
2,"Whispers of the Wicked Saints: This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable."
1,"The Worst!: A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
2,"Great book: This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night."
2,"Great Read: I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle."
1,"Oh please: I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
1,"Awful beyond belief!: I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
1,"Don't try to fool us with fake reviews.: It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?"
2,"A romantic zen baseball comedy: When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!"
2,"Fashionable Compression Stockings!: After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling."
2,"Jobst UltraSheer Thigh High: Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help."
1,"sizes recomended in the size chart are not real: sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it"
1,"mens ultrasheer: This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"
2,"Delicious cookie mix: I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix."
1,"Another Abysmal Digital Copy: Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."
2,"A fascinating insight into the life of modern Japanese teens: I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"
2,"i liked this album more then i thought i would: I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days."
1,"Problem with charging smaller AAAs: I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
1,"Works, but not as advertised: I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
1,"Disappointed: I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries."
1,"Oh dear: I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
2,"Based on the reviews here I bought one and I'm glad I did!: This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
1,"Incorrect disc!: I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
2,"happy with it...but: I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!"
1,"should be titled ""Hollywood Debacle"": The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
2,"Is this great TV??? You bet it is: Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie ""Glitter"" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC."
1,"Nothing you don't already know: If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
1,"Unfortunately it wasn't entertaining in the least bit.: When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last ""vibe"" Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA."
2,"Rochelle explains It All for You: Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
2,"More great playing: Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing. Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control. Listen to Larry's take on ""My Funny Valentine"" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'. A very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again."
1,"Doesn't work on a Mac: It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"
1,"Very Frustrating: My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the ""power-up segments"" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it."
1,"Mind numbing: This game makes you do the same things over and over, it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level. There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order. We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it, but this one is a dog!"
1,"Cannot recommend: As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must."
2,"Alaska sourdough: REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes."
2,"Old and good: This book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but Ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in Alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen, just a pot of sourdough."
2,"autumn: got this for my daughter in NC, she is now making prefect bread. Wish she lived closer to make me some"
2,"Fast mp3 download of music waxed decades ago: One of these 26 songs played as background music on a YouTube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of Russia. I hunted down the melody, read the English lyrics, then decided to see what else was in the album. Downloaded the full album for $15 via Amazon mp3 downloader, and now happily listen to the melodies (interspersed) on my iPod."
1,"Maybe I got a bad one.: My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it."
2,"Sylvania 6620LDG 20"" Flat Panel LCD TV with Built in DVD player: Light weight, space saving very attractive design. Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil. The quality, the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy."
1,"TERRIBLE!! DO NOT BUY THIS: I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
1,"*** BEWARE ***: This TV is set so that it is not capable of a ""recall"" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying."
2,"Kitchen TV: I bought this to replace a 13"" tube tv in my kitchen. What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space. The picture is good, and the internal DVD player is a bonus. All in all, a good purchase."
2,"Nice for the money: The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price."
1,"Disappointed Romanian!: This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is ""clean and proper"" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are ""tourist guides"" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment."
2,"Great travel guide to Europe!: This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!"
1,"Not the best: I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
2,"Good but received defective book: I bought this book because we are moving to Germany and I wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in Europe that we could travel too. Unfortunately pages 457-480 on Greece are not in English - looks to be Spanish. There was some sort of printing problem! But I found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries."
2,"From The Label:: From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years."
1,"Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.: Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2"" OD copper pipe.0 Star because they won't accept returns on it.5 stars because I figure it's actually worth $12-15/foot and since they won't take a return I figure I can sell it and make $40-50 on this deal"
2,"Hunting the Hard Way: Thia was a gift for my Husband, who loved the book. It arrived on the date we were told it would."
1,"Disappointing: The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
2,"Homer or Moses?: An extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use. For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library. I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above."
1,"Very poor quality.: The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
1,"Scraped across the whole top.: Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen."
2,"unknown Africa: You don't expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced. Me from the white world, don't understand the lyrics, but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa, soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem. The soft almost borred voice of Oliver N'goma fits pefectly in the music. The CD is recorded in France Paris, you can hear that professionals have been working on the CD. A must for a hot, lazy night.greetings Arno, Amsterdam"
1,"Didn't live up to expectations.: I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better."
1,"Profound then. Truly horrible now.: The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
2,"Definitely enjoyed!: This was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant. It seems to be very user friendly also....my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time."
2,"Even Mommy has fun with this one!: My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!"
2,"Great combination of creativity and adventure: My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!"
2,"Rapunzel: This is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it. I like to play to if they would let me! So much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing Great game. Not at all what you would think a Barbie game would be. Great fun for all!!"
1,"[Not what I expected]: ... My daughter and I loved the movie. She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game. Absolutely no challenge, and very little interaction. It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money."
1,"barbie rapunzel = crying child: My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to ""explore somewhere else in the castle.""Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is ""currently disabled."" And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks. If you don't want a crying little girl, avoid this game!"
2,"Barbie as Rapunzel: A Creative Adventure: I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
2,"Use your imagination!: My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by ""decorating"" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages."
1,"Not so good - ok for a rental!: This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."
1,"NOT OS X but MAC CLASSIC: NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
1,"Bad Deal!!: I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
2,"Smells divine.: This is my second bottle of sheer freesia, I just love this fragrance, its a light delicate sent, beautiful, like a summer day."
1,"Very disappointed!: This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!"
2,"Creepy: Wow, what people will do behind jealousy and revenge - there are some doors you should not open, and if you do - be prepared for what you find behind it!"
1,"audio options non existent: While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock."
2,"Sooo JAMMIN', too trill: Man, some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production, everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man"
2,"Dirty South: This is probably the best southside CD to ever come out. Pretty much every song has a guest or 2 on the track. From the late Fat Pat, to Botany Boys, Mr. 3-2, Big Steve, Chris Ward, H.A.W.K, and many more. This is how a southside CD should always be."
2,"Good book: Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it. Excellent photos as well.I kept looking for a photo of me and my then-wife, but I wasn't there long enough. But shewas :-)"
2,"voices from the farm: i have a copy of this book and love it and can't wait til the revised version comes out in a few weeks"
2,"Little one, maid of Israel: Bill Harvey has a wonderful gift of making history come alive in this book. This book awakens a sense of wonder at the possiblility of a real relationship with God as you follow the faithfulness of one little girl in ancient times. Young girls ages 5-15 will love this book. It has always been one of my most loved treasures, a real Keeper !"
1,"It Drew Air: This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book."
2,"comfy,warm.. but run big: just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me."
1,"Buyer Beware!!: I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!"
1,"Ariel Litte Mermaid with pearl kit: Arrived very quickly and it is a cute topper however I wouldn't have bought it if they didn't provide instructions!!!! I should have listened to the other reviews.... If you are hoping to get more than the topper DO NOT BUY THIS!! So annoyed I have this Ariel and have no idea how to decorate the cake."
1,"No instructions included - do not trust seller: Promised with this item are ""Complete Instructions"" and the additional pledge that ""Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time!"" I received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet. To boot, Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller. All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer. Let's hope that yields some results. Meanwhile, I'm wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller :/"
2,"Why is SOULWAX ignored by critics & consumers alike?!: I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their ""rock"" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their ""2 Many DJs"" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, ""Nite Versions"" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release ""Nite Version"" on 12"" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming ""Sexor"" debut...?"
2,"OMG Soulwax owns: wow - this is like the most amazing album ever. Every track so rocks...specially1) E-talking2) NyLipps3) I love Techo.great job guysMusicChoice played their whole album this Saturday night..and I was jamming to it the whole time going ""wow"".one more thing, if you're not into House/Techno/electronic then you don't want none of this, cause you won't feel it."
1,"Slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie: 2 stars of 5 for this slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie."
2,"Thank you for Releasing it!!!!!: I loved this movie as a kid and I am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally! If you want to see a great 80's movie, this is it!"
1,"Very Not Worth Your Time: The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages."
2,"Very fun and educational: Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range."
1,"Ludicrous and silly: I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly."
2,"Artistry: I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar."
1,"Caution!: These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
2,"textbook: Book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated. Easy transaction would buy again"
2,"a great book for Historical romance lovers: This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels."
2,"YES!!!: When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series."
1,"Not the best in the series: Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
1,"ADDONICS PORTABLE CD DRIVE - I am disappointed in its performance: I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
1,"Too Uncomfortable and Too Big: These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
2,"Very authentic: This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
1,"Not the best: I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills."
1,"Doesn't Fit: I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!"
2,"You need a good memory: I play this with my grandchildren. It teaches us both the value of a good memory and is challenging for all. You sometimes miss the most obvious. Lots of fun--tic tac toe with a twist!"
2,"Kelly Club Pet Parade at HIT!! My Daughter Loves IT!!: My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the ""Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!"" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, ""train"" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse."
2,"Loads of fun!: My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner!"
1,"easy and fun for 3-4yr olds: fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue. It's a shame my 4yr old really likes it."
2,"Hours of Fun for my 4 and 6 year olds: We purchased this game a year ago and my girls still love to play it. Lot's of activities, they love to decorate the floats and watch the parade."
2,"slip on 2 1/2 in. heel shoes: i am completely satisfied in the manner my order was delivered.the shoes are just as awesome as the advertisement showed them to be."
2,"DDR is cooool!: This cd is really great.BUT ITS NOT A GAME!they're not long versons though, only 90 odd seconds each.If that Claire, also from the UK (who was disappointed with the cd) wants to get in touch, i know where you can get games with the songs you want.I'm assuming you're after all the cool songs from euromix.If so, they are on 2nd and 3rd mix games from japan.but there are also US versions available too."
2,"Amazing: i have ordered this cd of here but it will take abit to get to me as i live in England. But i have danced and sang along to it at the arcades ive been to and i think its great if you love to dance. My favorite songs are what a feeling and in the navey!! i also like captain jack but i love them all.."
1,"I got fooled...: I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"

2,"MORE THAN LETTERS...: I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN"
2,"Worth the wait!: JMM has never released a bad album. Many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits. For some reason, radio hasn't played some of his great songs from his latest albums. ""Goes Good With Beer"" and ""Little Devil"" would be great singles to spice up country radio. ""Letters From Home"" deserves to be single of the year and ""Cool"" is not far behind. The more I listen to the album, the more I love it."
1,"letters from home: i like letters from home cuz it tells a story that if you really listen you can acctually hear john michael montgomery tell his story of soldiers and all that stuffi liked it and i like punk rock and rock so it must be good if i like it"
2,"no good: I gave it 5 stars because my little dog had so much fun riping it apart but only took him 24 hrs to do it buy that is 23 hrs longer than other balls"
2,"ESTE LIBRO CONTIENE TODO: LO QUE PENSE QUE NO ME INTERESABA SABER SOBRE EL BOX Y SUS CAMPEONES...PERO ME CAUTIVO Y LO LEI HASTA EL FINAL !AHORA SI PUEDO DISCUTIR DE BOX CON MI ESPOSO Y MIS CU��ADOS...��Y HASTA CON MI SUEGRO, QUE ES EX BOXEADOR !"
2,"Oh!: This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!"
2,"Delicious and Addictive: This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores."
2,"Oh where Oh where have my Oh's gone?: I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that ""the site who has everything including a church"" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(."
2,"One of a kind book for timber frame building.: My husband loves this book. He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by."
1,"no technical information: this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building"
2,"Hanford Mills museum: My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy."
1,"you will not be able to buils a timber frame house: This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder."
2,"Outstanding guidebook for building your own timberframe home: My wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide. Although we have construction skills, this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process. We can't wait to build another. We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house."
1,"Excellent book, very poor e-book editing: Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book."
2,"A very good how-to manual.: If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project."
1,"Poor instructions, but once you figure it out... kinda cool: These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in ""hot"" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, ""well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.""Should be more explicit in the instructions. (We were using the star wars version of this product)."
2,"Great Graphics!: 2006 Coast to Coast for PC is great! The graphics are awesome... The game is what I had hoped for and a lot more!!"
1,"Dont run out to get Outrun unless your from 1985: Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to ""Battlefield"". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake."
2,"My Henry: I had Henry back in the 70's. I don't remember him with a nose since it was chewed off, but he was well loved. He's long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about. I can't believe I've found him again!! Nobody can replace my original worn Henry, but I'm so excited to have his clone back!!"
2,"Henry has come home...: I had Henry back in the early 70's. I am forty now and still have my original. I bought a new one for my Dad who is ill because I knew he would get the significance. Henry got me through the insecurities I had as a child and I am hoping he does the same for my Dad as he battles terminal cancer.Thanks for making him again."
2,"Charisma: What it is about ""Henry Dog"". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an ""incurable"" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a ""real"" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14"" and 3"". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle ""Henry Dog`s"" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive."
2,"I found it! Henry Dog!: I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found ""him"", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!"
2,"A Contemporary Fairytale Sure to Delight!: While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works."
1,"Not Patterns - but Detailed Sketches: Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book."
2,"great gift: my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her"
1,"Product didn't match the picture/description: Unless they sent me the wrong product by mistake, the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered. I was under the impression I would receive two (a pair) of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes. Instead I received ONE foot cushion, filled with another material (not water) that you attach to your foot via a toe strap. I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund. Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy... they make returns very easy!"
1,"Good for a laugh: I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up."
1,"As Bad a Production as Possible: This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD."
1,"Not professional quality: I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others."
1,"three to four stars - depending...: Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students."
1,"Good songs, bad cover.: This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by ""the Starlite Singers""."
1,"New Wave 80s: I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it."
1,"Don't Be Fooled!: I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists! In fact, it says various artists, which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs. It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is, after all, a compilation of music by various artists! Duh! So, don't waste your money. I will probably throw these in the trash as I'm a purist and I want original, not wedding reception music!"
1,"Buyers Beware!!!!!!!!!: This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!"
2,"Sony basic Hi8 Handycam Rocks!: Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes. This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony. It does everything I need and does it well... I got a great deal."
1,"BEWARE!!: Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ...."
2,"80's High Tech with Rock Emotion: Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&M projects. The song ""Curious Kind"" is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!"
1,"Never gets going: This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
2,"Now, The Rest of the Story: I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!"
2,"The baseball benchmark: I didn't refer to Baseball America as such. It was Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty who said it. And who am I to contradict? The best columnists in the game, from Peter Gammons, Tracy Ringolsby and Jayson Stark, to detailed information in ALL of baseball, from the Major Leagues to Japan, stats, scores, and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information, there's not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a Baseball America subscriber. You got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow (being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months). Top 10 prospects from every team till its massive Top 100 list, Baseball America covers it all. I know, I have been subscribed for 2 years now, and I can't think of living without it!"
2,"Perfect for the die-hard baseball fan: I have read Baseball America off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription. This is the best place to get coverage of the minors, college, and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do."
2,"Peek a Fun!: We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already. They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well."
2,"Excellent product: These Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items. I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more,"
1,"Great for Twins: I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price."
2,"They're blocks - keep that in mind: We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can ""spin"" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a ""look at me"" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)"
1,"Would have expected better!: I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters. However, the letters are rubbing off. For the price I paid that was dissapointing. Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun."
2,"Cute gift for a little baby: Although I felt it looked a bit chinsy, the mother had it on her wish list and was very happy to receive them."
2,"Great Blocks: My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends."
2,"Awesume! BEST BLOCKS EVER!: THIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSON'S FAVORITE, SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD. THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING."
2,"keeps his attention: My little boy is just getting interested in these blocks. They are too cute! He's learning to manipulate the block in his hands. The little things inside the blocks are adorable. Some spin, some twirl, some rock. A definate upgrade from the standard wooden blocks."
2,"Great value.: This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny."
2,"Wonderful but not worth $80.: These are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed $79.99. They can be purchsed for about $20 many other places."
2,"Worth the investment: This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the ""fun"" factor. For younger babies that may not ""get it"" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months. Give him a couple of months and he'll really dig them!"
1,"waste off money: this is not waterproof.its GARBAGE where batteries go in broke,while trying to adj.DO NOT BUY.you turn the end to control it,that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff?????"
2,"California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy: The California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy,is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning,my other half likes it."
1,"small didn't work: It is very small compared to what i thought it would be, but even so it didn't work when we got it"
2,"Makes for fascinating reading.: Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
2,"Pretty Nifty!: I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
1,"Yet another unsubstantiated case....: While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
1,"Molly Myers: Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
1,"Gardening lawn book: Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again."
1,"It's a knock off.: The official Chrono Trigger OST has 3 discs. This version has some of the major tracks on it, the audio quality is good, but Caveat Emptor (buyer beware) this is a Chinese knock-off.Oh and if you buy the 3 disc version, make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading ""FX"", for this is also a counterfeit. The serial numbers on the real soundtrack CDs are PSCN-5021, PSCN-5022, and PSCN-5023."
1,"Just a few.: These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
1,"It was ""ok"" but I won't watch it again: I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen."
2,"Loved it! (P.S. Stephen Colletti is so hot!): I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!"
2,"mask maker: It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming"
2,"mask maker: I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert."
2,"NOT the worst American B-Movie: This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!"
1,"MASK OF FAMILIARITY: MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need."
1,"Unmasked..................: Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
2,"A museum exhibit inside a book: This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
2,"Great resource for Chinese/Eastern medincine: This is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing. Unfortunately it is long out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy of this text, you will not be dissappointed. In fact, if you are unhappy with it, I will be happy to purchase it from you as I have many peers that would happily use it."
2,"Why Is This A Good Book?: As someone who has been practicing Chinese Medicine for 16 years in San Diego (www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com), I find this book an excellent resource for anyone who wants and in dept primer into the theoretical basis and practical application of a system of medicine that originates in the Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the natural balance found in Nature and agriculture."
2,"A Book That Is Worth a Second Look: This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine."
2,"Best game ever: This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play."
1,"Guitar in Absentia: With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music."
1,"Stiff and Smells like drying paint: You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close."
1,"Review of Pillow: This was a joke. I am sending the pillow back. Does not come close to what was advertised. I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head. I am giving it one star just so I can post this. I only wish the stars could go negative."
1,"Don't bother: The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new."
1,"Worthless and cheap: How is this thing awful? let me count the ways..First off, it took an unatural amount of time to get here. Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh."
1,"Will not be purchasing another one of these: It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."
1,"False Advertisement: The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
1,"Not Like the Old Formula: The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review."
2,"haven't found better yet...: This is the only product that can manage my hair without making it stiff or sticky."
2,"smoothing serum: The product is wonderful for my hair which is very curly and tends to be frizzy. Smooths it and gets rid of allof the friz. Use it once a day, even in damp weather"
1,"The product I received this time is like fake one: I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount."
1,"If it ain't broke don't fix it: I have been using this product for 5+ years. It was wonderful. About 1 year ago the company changed packaging and the product changed slightly. The bottle is taller now and something is missing from the serum. Doesn't work as well as it used to work. I will not be purchasing this item because of the change."
1,"Review of Artec Textureline Smoothing Serum: I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"
2,"LOVE IT!: I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it! It leaves my hair so soft, smelling good and you can't even tell that I have any product in my hair. I'm reading a lot of reviews where people are saying that they can't find it anywhere. Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!"
2,"The Best !!!!: Dick Curless has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His music ranges from thought provoking, to toe tapping, beer drinking music. One of his best renditions is Winter's Coming On Again. People who appreciate good music from any genre will love this CD. I can not recommend it highly enough."
2,"Great control racquet: A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made."
1,"DO NOT BUY, A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME!!!: My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money."
1,"Bad skating technique: I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
1,"A complete waste: My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile."
1,"4 year old BORED with this after 2 weeks: I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it."
1,"Barbie's Boring Ice Show: I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game."
1,"WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! BARBIE HAS SUNK TO NEW LOWS: This is the WORST CD-ROM game I have ever seen! My 7-year-old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour. It is slow, skippy, etc. running on a new computer! Don't waste your money like we did, skip right over this dud."
2,"IT'S GREAT!: All the other reviews say this product is boring and ""save your money""....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater ""never falls""?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!"
2,"A good game to buy.: I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."
2,"Great Game: My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went."
1,"Not really what I wanted: For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called ""Perfect Gentleman"" with 2 titles on it: ""Ooh la la"" and ""One more Chance"". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy."
2,"Rare find: A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read."
1,"Fire Truck Puzzle: The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality."
2,"Dark Horses a must have CD: I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon."
1,"Don't buy from Eforcity -- slow, disingenuous: What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
1,"Don't waste your money: I ordered this because my apartment doesn't have a light switch in the living room. It worked fine for about a week, then occassionaly would take 3 or 4 clicks to get the light to turn out. Now it will work 1 out of maybe 100 attempts, and only within 6 feet of the outlet. Terrible"
1,"Does not work!: It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it."
2,"Plug it in and it works!: Pull the battery saver tab, plug the unit into the wall and plug-in the device you want to control and everything works! I tried it from 25 feet away and through one wall and the remote turned my device on and off without a hitch!"

2,"The most charming, captivating work from LJ Smith!: The plot and characters are incredible. Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!"
2,"Beautiful Love Story: I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is ""This is a paranormal disaster area!"""
2,"The Best Yet!!!: Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!"
2,"The Best: I just re-read Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it. It has everything that you could want and more. Just one questionAre Mary-Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart, longing for the one person who can make their life complete?To find out keep reading!!"
2,"Soul-mates: I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"
2,"Possibly the Best out of this series!: It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"
2,"Amazing!: LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!"
2,"One of the best books I've ever read!: DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies."
2,"Daughters of Darkness-THE BEST: I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
2,"One of her best in the Night World series!: Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it."
2,"2 Humans and 3 vampires after a vampire slayer: I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of read it about 50 times, really! It's such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times! But it didn't really explain how Jeramey got there. How would he how where they were going?"
2,"I'm hooked and I want some more ...: I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called ""Daughters of Darkness"" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???"
2,"L.J. Smith has so many correct details....: I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
2,"It was great!!!: I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night."
1,"Disappointing: I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead."
2,"mirroring the reader: I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece."
1,"Don't Waste Yout Time: Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time, most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information; but it's dry, overly-intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested. If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it."
1,"Thick, dry and packed full of somewhat useful information: To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."
2,"Kylie takes a bite at subtlety....: Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA."
2,"A rare & wondeful treat: I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities."
2,"nifty: It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Works well too."
2,"Grandson enjoyed maybe 20 times!: Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again"
1,"Very annoying!: This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus ""feature"" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed."
1,"Extremely Disappointed with this video: I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
1,"Just so-so: This is a DVD with footage of a ""Come Out and Meet Thomas"" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the ""party/interview"" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either."
1,"More than Thomas, Not Geared Toward Children As Much: I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections."
1,"A long promo for the Thomas center(s): Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."
1,"Poor DVD: Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD."
1,"My Son finds it annoying: My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
1,"Feels like a commercial...: All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*"
2,"Makes you not want to sleep at night.....: This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!"
1,"$25K warranty isn't included in packaging or at APC site: This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this ""$25,000"" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?"
2,"Great little surge protector: Great value for a surge protector. I've got 'em on lots of electronics (printers, phones, laptops) that don't need a full power strip or universal power supply (UPS). Very portable for laptops, in case you're travelling."
1,"Too Small: I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy."
2,"A good product available in convenient range of sizes: This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs."
1,"TOM ATKINSON REVIEW: I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND. I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND, SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY. SO FAR I'AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON"
1,"Cut smaller than usual: I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch."
1,"Wrong item sent.: I got the shippment quickly. But wrong items was sent. I have to return it to the seller. I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything."
1,"Too bad....: Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."
2,"Dockers do the job.: This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product."
1,"False advertising: If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants."
1,"Don't Trust the Images: Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. ""Cafe,"" for example, should be ""Coffee."" Despite the fact that the image for ""Cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""Cafe"" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got."
1,"So disappointed: I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are ""deals"" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron."
2,"Fantastic Book: This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children."
1,"Disturbing: Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher."
2,"A Taste of Italy: Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying."
2,"Perfect book for a long flight....: .... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above."
2,"Delicious reading: I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a ""trifle overdone"" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons."
2,"Wonderfully romantic book that sweeps you to Italy: THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world."
2,"I just wanted to cook for my husband on those dark and stary nights...: This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!"
2,"One of the best!: If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great story, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect book. I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy. All who have read it, especially women, love it."
2,"Cameriere!: I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard ""chick lit"" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to ""Roman young stud"" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" - it was a fun read."
2,"Food porn, and I mean that in the best possible way: I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!"
2,"Patricia Cornwell rocks! Best mystery writer on record!: Like all of her Scarpetta mystery novels, Patricia Cornwell has proven again that she must have been one dynamite of a Coroner when she was practicing. She has a wealth of information in her books and it is so interesting to follow as she progresses to solving the mystery. I've never enjoyed reading as much as when I pick up a Cornwell novel."
2,"Rekindling Love: Mistakes can never be undone, but rectification is possible. Years after their marriage died, Ross and Tessa are drawn back together when one of their sons is diagnosed with a fatal illness. Returning to what has not been his home in a long time, Ross is met with a mix of hostility, need, and love. Before much time passes, he realizes that his son is not the only one in need of healing. With a society that has been torn apart by issues just like this, the potential audience for it is vast. Mistakes are not glossed over, but proven not to be fatal. This will give hope to thousands."
1,"Worst English dub of a great TV series: This sucked!The WORST English dub EVER!Crayon Shinchan is long TV series that lasted close to 12 years in Japan. Funimation did NOT purchase the entire series just a handful of episodes, so you don't see how the stories and characters developed and changed over the many seasons.The English dub they made changed the entire dialogue and Americanized practically ALL the characters and situations to an extreme low brow humor. Granted the original show did have a lot of puns, and low brow humor as well, but Shinchan did retain an innocence for his mischief, being the focus that he was always this incredible force of fun shaped as a 5 year old boy. True fans of the manga and series should NOT buy this lame production by Funimaiton."
1,"A Piece of Crap!: Noisy, crude five point vibration pad.NOT! a massager, a vibration pad!We purchased three of these and we sent back three of these!Worthless, no, worse than worthless!"
1,"No theory what so ever: The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"
1,"You sure can tell this was written by an accountant...: There sure is some exciting literature out there. This is not it. The material is very dry...desert comes to mind. I am using this book for my accounting 211 course at OSU, and boy is it fun (note the sarcasm). And what's with the dates in the example problems (such as 12/31/x1)? What is that? Were they too afraid to put a 9 in there? They didn't think we, the students, could handle it? But hey, I'm not bitter or anything. I don't even think you COULD make accounting interesting. A must read! (HA!)"
1,"wrong item: I was going to get a book with a ISN number of 0072316373...But today, I got one with 0070412901...So I need you send my money beac to my account, and give me a well reason why you let the seller mail me a totally different book again, It is the second time I get an item with wrong number"
1,"Worthless: How this man has managed to write so many books while knowing nothing about 1) travel and 2) archaeology is a mystery to me. First he shows up in Jordan with no local money on a Friday (you'd think someone passing themselves off as a knowledgeable traveller would have figured out banks in an Arab country are closed on the Muslim sabbath) Then he continues on with a series of quack theories about aliens, and technologically advanced ancient civilizations, and harps that make rocks float. There not even good quack theories, like Hancock or Buval (who, while equally worthless, at least make an attempt to back up their theories) Read something else."
2,"There's no other book like this one!: There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story, this isn't it. It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well."
1,"Don't bother!: What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!"
2,"Lincoln and his time: For the mpost part any book by David Donald is worth the time and effort to read. This book offers fresh insights into the perception of Lincoln. Belongs on the shelf of every person interested in 19th century America."
2,"Explains why economics and politics don't mix!: Hazlitt's view is simple: economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time. He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace."
2,"a brilliant, well-written economics primer: Hazlitt presents a clear, concise lesson on basic economics. His message is well-articulated and well-supported. This is a must read for every person who has ever worked or voted (or is planning to do either) because it discusses the essentials in both economic theory and the politics that put the theory into practice.Unfortunately, there are some erroneous ideas in this book. Hazlitt occasionally makes claims or implies that the government should make some interventions into the economy; he also seems to think that capitalism's merit lies in its service to the ""common good."" However, these fallacies are rare, and they do not significantly detract from the book.For a great back-to-back lesson in economics and its moral base, read this book followed by CAPITALISM: THE UNKNOWN IDEAL by Ayn Rand."
1,"Don't waste your money.: If you are new to Economics, this is one book that you can skip. It is not useful nor ""mandatory reading"" if you are looking to understand the subject better. There is not even one chart or graph included in this book!!! Stick with Naked Economics: Undressing the Dismal Science or Economics for Dummies as these two titles will serve you better."
1,"More of a personal opinion than that of economics: When I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book."
1,"Not what it claims to Be: I was actually looking for a book on economics... This book is more of a conservative rant. It's not so much that I disagree with what he says so much as the fact that its all politics and very little economics. Buy this book if you want to hear how much the author thinks liberalism stinks... not if you want ""Economics in one lesson."" I definitely feel like I got tricked into buying it."
2,"The best book on Economics...: ...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!"
2,"3.5 Stars-A useful supplementary text for lower division microeconomic principles courses only: This book is useful for teaching lower division undergraduate students the principles of microeconomics.It can be used as a supplementary book.Hazlitt emphasizes the important concept of opportunity cost,but neglects to incorporate any discussion of spillover effects and externalities(positive and negative,depletable and undepletable),market failure,public goods,the theory of second best,adverse selection,moral hazard, the principal-agent problem,etc.It is interesting that all these missing topics were originally covered by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations(1776),especially in Part V."
1,"Title is a Scam: When someone is intentionally deceptive in order to sell books or to capture an audience this lowers the value of what they have to say to absolute zero."
1,"NO Help: This book did not help me with my economics class. Even though I passed the course with a B. This book reads more like a novel and really does not simplify economics at all. I work better with definitions and examples and this book gives none."
1,"Polemic and Outdated: I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have ""the answer,"" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general."
1,"Too simplistic: Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat."
1,"This ain't no economics book!: I was expecting a book on economics 101, so maybe I might understand market forces, PE ratios, stuff like that.It's just a big argument for a libertarian government. Not even particularly good arguments either - they're all based on metaphors, like the broken window (paraphrased from memory):'Even though they may get paid, a community does not get rich fixing broken windows. That holds the community still, it does not push it forward.'That's a fine argument and all, but that's not teaching. Metaphors are mental manipulation... give me all the pros and cons and let me decide. Or better: give me the damn facts.And it's outdated too. The book is 50 years old. We are so NOT in Post WWII economics."
1,"No lessons learned: This is one of the most disappointing purchases I have made on Amazon.The book is one long, myopic, libertarian apology."
2,"Best book on Economics for the general reader: This is an excellent introduction to Economics. Hazlitt was a clear writer, and his analysis of fallacious economic thought is very informative. You don't have to be a student of Economics - this is a book that can benefit every reader. I just wish more of our politicians had read this book."
2,"If you don't have this, get it!: This book is a wonderful illustration of the simple (so simple they go unnoticed) principles of a market economy and the many fallacies of adding socialism to the mix.I could have easily given this 4.5 stars, but I didn't have the option. The only thing that kept me from giving it 5 was that Hazlitt partially caves in about halfway through the book on the topic of unions. Unions are tantamount to coersion and have no place in a market economy."
2,"Read the angry anti-Hazlitt reviews for a real indication: I think beyond the fact that Hazlitt produces a succinct and well-argued explanation for why free markets are the best arrangements in economic relationships, what is really wonderful is reading the screeds of those readers that he pisses off! Read the rabid ranting temper tantrum of the one reader who amazingly was accepted to the University of Chicago and you can see how ideas that actually support free thought and productive profitable endeavors drive lunatics like this crazy - its awesome!! This dork probably marches against the WTO."
2,"Give this book to a your children.: Economics in One Lesson elucidates the basic principles of Economics in a simple, understandable language. If you are just starting out on economics, I would recommend this as your first book. College Textbooks will bore you and treatise like Human Action by L.W. Mises are pretty hard for a beginner.Also, be sure to give this book to your children. Schools don't teach economics, a most important of subjects.With that said, I would like to comment on many 1 star reviews. Notice how they don't comment on the content of the book. Economics is a Science, and it is better to put away your Political Glasses when studying it."
2,"ECONOMICS IN ONE LESSON: Economics in One Lesson is another great ""must read"" book. Like Bastiat's ""The Law,"" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called 'leaders' are utterly ignorant.Don't you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful."
2,"Never more needed than today: Sure, a few of the specific examples cited 60+ years ago are no longer relevant today, but the basic lessons are absolutely and permanently valid and need more than ever to be understood by at least a majority of the voting public.The sad fact is that Americans can go through the entire public school system and ""higher education"" without learning the first thing about economic science (while getting bombarded with self-serving economic propaganda). Thus public gullibility to the fallacies cited by Hazlitt seems no less pervasive now than back then, while the resultant cancerous growth of government economic meddling has only increased.Here's a revolutionary fantasy: Make this book a required study by all high school students. Imagine what that would do for the kinds of politicians who get elected in the future.BTW, you can get the nice hard-cover edition at less cost directly from the Mises Institute."
2,"Economics even you will Understand: For all who avoided economics like the plague, this is the book for you.very informative, and gives the novice a good foundation of the subject... Check it out.. next time you argue economics with uncle Fred, you wont sound like such a dope"
2,"Simply brilliant!: This is a great start to learning Austrian economics, or rather, any kind of economics. All members of Congress should be required to read this before being allowed to vote on any bills. Peter Schiff's ""Crashproof"" would be a great followup to reading Economics in One Lesson. And for the more serious student of Austrian economics, especially in these times, you should read von Mises Theory of Money and Credit, and Rothbard's The Great Depression."
2,"One lesson that EVERYONE needs to learn!: As a student and teacher of economics, this book has proved to be an invaluable resource! The lesson is simple and direct, yet one that many people fail to apply. This should be required reqding for anyone involved in the development of economic policy (or any other arm of policy making, for that matter). Whether you agree with Hazlitt's conclusions about how the market works or not, you cannot dispute the key lesson of this book. It is entertaining to read, particularly easy for a book about economics. I highly recommend it!"
2,"Textbook: Should have been a nationwide elementary school textbook for the past 60 years.Upon reading this book, and knowing your fellow Americans will have, one couldn'timagine the losses of freedom that we are experiencing now. An absolute must read."
2,"Our Senators and Reps should read and heed: This is not a new book;perhaps that's why it is so useful.There is no gobblygook, no arcane economic theories with fancy lables.What there are in this book are many examples of - - if the government takes this action to make this or that happen, the unintended consequences have proven to be and will probably be again something quite different, and usually not positive.Sound experiential economics in my view, clearly written; and a tremendous help to understanding what will probably happen if the nation takes on more debt, subsidizes this or that interest, taxes one interest at the expense of another, etc.I liked it; I could read and understand it."
2,"Great Book: Very easy to read, simple arguments that destroy many fallacies in current political rhetoric. I learned a lot from this book without feeling like I had to muddle through it. I benefitted from taking micro and macro before reading, but it's not necessary, and anyone interested in learning about how special interests kill the consumer and taxpayer because their well-being is easier to measure and is effected more immediately (aka every modern economic issue) has an obligation to read this book."
1,"Painful: I wouldn't recommend this book to an enemy. True, the information may be worthy, but the writing style and the narration were horrible. It is definitely NOT written (nor read) in a conversational manner. I'm willing to cut the narrator some slack as he was only reading what was written, however better inflection, phrasing, pauses, etc... would have greatly helped this otherwise tedious book.I couldn't even finish it. I suffered through the first 5 disks and after all that investment in time I couldn't bring myself to listen to the 6th. Its just that poorly written.I'll restate the fact that the message -- the information -- is worth hearing, its simply written in such a tedious manner that I couldn't stand to hear it through the end.I think I'll donate it to my local library."
1,"Unsatisfactory and very outdated: I am in my 60's and thought it would be a good time to remedy what I perceived as a gap in my education, economics. I never had a course in economics and the only book I had read was Heilbroner's Worldly Philosophers, a satisfying but very general overview as I recall. I probably read Heilbroner in the late 70's.I'm an audible subscriber and got Economics in One Lesson from them. I can only say that the book was dated, full of economic events that were referenced from WWII, and excessively polemical and rigid.I read it some time ago but it made enough of a bad impression on me that when I saw it in my suggestion list around number 250, I just had to get onto this page and say what a terrible disappointment the book was.I think the book should be retitled, Economics in One Polemic: The Shortest and Surest Way to Understand the Economics of the Late 1940's and the 1950's."
1,"Don't Be Fooled By the Title of This Book: The only economic lessons in it are a very biased critique of any economic policy other than capitalist doctrine. I wanted to learn about economics and was so disappointed in this outdated, one-sided book."
1,"Hypocritical, Biased, outdated and misleading: This book opens with the author explaining his objective analysis of popular fallacies within economics. In no way is this book objective, it is not so much a introduction to economics than a book with a political agenda. He rarely shows two sides of the arguement, spins fact real well all the while omitting valuable information contrary to his veiws. DONT READ THIS AS YOUR FIRST ECONOMICS BOOK, and if you do read it, take it with a grain of salt."
1,"Capitalism straight, in small unpalatable doses: If you want your faith in market forces and low taxation reinforced, this is a straightforward, but blinkered attempt to make you forget all about government regulation. Funny that west-European countries with bigger taxation and more government influence have less crime, better education, better health care, better TV programmes than the US. They also organise their politics better, so that the tax money is better spent. It did set me right on one or two points, and parts are written in a spuriously funny way, but it is too biased to be really informing . Clearly the writer has never listened to people he doesn't agree with.If you have an open mind compare this dangerous nonsense with the writings of Naomi Klein to see how unfettered capitalism works out in practice."
1,"Right-libertarian views presented as fact: The problem I have with Hazlitt's economics primer is that much of the information he presents as fact is nothing but right-libertarian ideology.Hazlitt attempts to ""explode liberal myths"" by taking out of context the social advances America has made in the last 70 years. The author believes that unchecked corporate power will liberate the economy and, therefore, humanity.Hazlitt is obviously a corporate apologists who refuses to scrutinize the ""successes"" of liberalized trade policies throughout the world. A look at any number of third world countries will reveal the true outcome of relinquishing government and social controls of the economy."
1,"ASTOUNDING: It is astounding that anyone in this age can seriously recommend this book. It has no bearing on the world economy and is blatantly anti labor and anti government regulation. It is hopelessly out of date."
1,"how to fail economics 101: This book preaches a very right wing kind of economics. If you can imagine one of Rush Limbaugh's readers or helpers writing a primer on economics, then this is it. Keep government small etc. The author most likely was an Austrian school follower. As it is avaiable free on Limewire, maybe get a free copy on the Net or browse it in your local library. No need to buy unless you want to flesh out (sic) the ideas of Mr Limbaugh et al. The book relentlessly hammers home the ideas that government should be amall, self interest drives the economy forward and that state intervention is bad."
1,"Read this if You're Stupid and wish to be Fanatically Stupid: Very Stupid. Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this economic-libertarian garbage espouse), this is what comes out of your pencil. Read this book, turn off the real world, and turn on to a reactionary and libertarian-utopian rehash of greed, plunder, pillage and plutocracy WORSHIP touted as ""common sense."""
2,"Back to basics...: Sometimes back to basics is the clearest path towards understanding current realities. It is amazing to me that a book written in 1946 is still so fundamentally relevant."
2,"A great alternative perspective: Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy."
2,"Sanity in Economics: This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off."
2,"Fine Summary: This is a great primer that should be read in all schools. Hazlitt does not deal in economic details here. Intead, Economics in One Lesson covers more useful ground for the average person: it cumulatively teaches us how to think logically about economic issues. And, of course, how you think is the basis for what you think. Even the casual reader will take away an ability to spot economic silliness, many of which spring from the same bad premises, the same elementary blindness to cause-and-effect. Economics in One Lesson provides the type of knowledge that stays with you for a lifetime."
2,"A good libertarian primer: This book is a little outdated, and a little heavy on the libertarianism, but otherwise it's a very easy read, and I particularly like some of the stories it uses to present basic economic ideas."
2,"Important: Just under two hundred pages, I learned more from this short book on Economics than from three entire textbooks in College. Concise, well worded and simplified reality. Anyone wanting to understand the market system and how it works can gain greatly by reading Hazlitt."
2,"Economics: Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times."
2,"Frighteningly Prophetic: An easy to understand overview of economics and, when considering the condition we are in today, scary! It explains a great deal about our current economic problems though originally written in the 40's."
2,"Great book: This is a great introduction to economic analysis. It is very well written and the examples are still surprisingly current.Bad economic thinking plagues the political and mediatic scene. Hazlitt focuses his effort on a key mistake, that of ignoring the unseen possibilities (or opportunity cost)."
2,"Great summary of some very difficult economic principles: This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won't be my last. He has an ""Adam Smith"" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who's to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title."
1,"over-simplified diatribe: Wow, this one is really out there. Only Any Rand and Ron Paul, who know nothing about economics, could recommend this book. For example, consider these laughable claims, that I paraphrase -The primary problem with economics as practiced is that no thought is given to the long term consequences of policies to all groups.There is no difference between supply and demand.The vast majority of economists are ignoramuses.It is all very simple; listen to me.If you can believe this stuff, read the book. You can get it online for free."
1,"More politics, less economincs: I wish I had read more of the reviews to learn that this book is less about economics and more about pushing a particular political point of view. The point of view is hard right and the current recession disproves most of the economic patter. After skimming a few pages I threw it away; I didn't even want it in the house."
1,"This book's title is misleading.: This is propaganda, not an economics lesson. The book is full of faulty logic apparently spewed to promote a libertarian agenda. I couldn't be less happy with this purchase."
1,"Seriously Flawed: Bottom line, there are some serious flaws in the author's thinking. For example, in chapter 11 (Tariffs), the author argues that imposing a $5 tariff on an import (sweaters from England) ends up costing the US. Never once does he add the $5 duty received into the equation. How can someone argue against an import tax without analyzing what happens to the revenues from that tax? When the next chapter stated that Exports must equal Imports, I quit reading.In short, I couldn't agree more with the author that all too often the analysis of costs/benefits focus is too narrow. Yet, in trying to expanding the analysis beyond the 'too narrow', the author's analysis in fact is often too narrow."
1,"Not a primer, way too political: Going to be brief here: If you are looking for an introductory to economics, begin your search elsewhere. Hazlitt has an opinion, and he presents it here. I was looking for something that presents both sides of sticky issues, but more importantly, spends a great deal of time on the fundamentals.This book fails in that respect. Keep looking. (Samuelson, Mankiw, Malkiel...)"
1,"Straight to the trash can!: Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!"
2,"Pretty cool: Let me first say I'm into HipHop(real Hiphop, slug, Atmosphere, etc). I have latelly been checking out the Euro scene of music(I don't know bought a Bmw could have been influencing me lol). I like this chick(not only cute) but she is cute and beats are catchy. Their music makes wanna make me drive fast. The older I get(30), the more I listen to beat and the complete way the music is put together. So liking the Goldfrapp stuff. So I by these cd's for my girl(while secretly ripping them to my zune). Right now working overtime to go check out Europe and stuff(not better than America, but different obviously the as an European visiting here. Good catchy cd, interesting use of instruments and keyboards. Did I mention she is cute little thing. Check out their videos they are a trip."
2,"Allison rocks!: I have just recently discovered Goldfrapp and boy look at what I have been missing out on!This disc is incredible! My only gripe...it needs to be longer!Number 1 is an excellent song so walk out into velvet!Such a shame that US radio does not play such a wonderous mix of techno & electronica on the airwaves, yet forces us to listen constantly to tired rap lyrics about hos and bling, dumb TV show contest winners and R&B; idiocy.Allison has them all beat, hands down!"
2,"Kids love it: It's Thomas! Kids love it. I can tolerate him better than Barney or those Wiggles. Still sounds so odd to hear George Carlin narrating a children's movie..."
2,"Great for kids!: As usual, Thomas and Friends are entertaining in all the best ways for kids! Good lessons and good fun."
2,"Chocolate delicious by body hottie: this book was delicious it was very interesting i never knew most of this stuff in thereit made me so hungry for chocolate and im a chocolate fanaticDELCIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!even the book tasted good~~~ body hottie"
2,"A Stellar Kid's Tape!: This is not your average kid's tape! Nancy Cassidy's wonderful alto voice invites even the musically challenged to sing along. As with all her tapes, there is a terrific mix of traditional and new music, use of many instruments, and varied musical styles. Even our one year-old dances when we put this on!"
1,"Too much kid-pop music for a dark, animated movie!: I don't like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third movies had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap... but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was (for the most part)dark!The only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was 'Lights Out' by P.O.D.!That re-mix of the song is the only reason why I bought this album!Not recommended for the whole album, just that one song..."
2,"TMNT Soundtrack: I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff."
2,"Egbert is such a wonderful name: After years of searching, which ended with a 400 or so page photocopied version with missing pages, I found this book. This book is the only in depth and detailed english language record of almost all vegetation on Okinawa and the Ryukyu islands that I know of. The information within is in both Japanese (an older style) and English. I know of no other place that this book exists aside from the post library on Torii Station."
2,"sweet musings for loss and love: Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended."
2,"The Art of Chinese Medical Science: I read this book, It's a good source of information related to Chinese Medicine. I would call it an Art of Chinese Medical science."
2,"What more do I need?: Price and function are two of the main reasons I now own this camcorder. I have webtv so I can capture all of the stills I need and do it quite easily and without software and a computer.Keep it simple stan is definitly my mantra and this camcorder helps me do just that. More functions and options would just go to waste and be confusing.It is light and ergonomic and I got a free tripod and camera bag with mine at circuit city. I wouldn't buy electronics on line again (been there done that). A longer battery life would be all I would ask for ."
2,"A great American Sisters book.: Ten year old Erna Anderson and her sixteen year old sister Alfreda lived lives of poverty in Sweden. Their father went to America seven years ago, and finaly sent for Mother and their little brother Karl. But Karl had died, and Mother was ill, so Erna and Alfreda would have to make the journey to America alone, in third class on the Titanic. The two sisters, seperated at first by poverty and sorrow, soon become friends. But when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, can they survive?"
1,"not quite what I was expecting: I originally bought one of Daniel's previous albums (the title had 'insomniac' in it). the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals. I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album."
2,"Agressive, Wild, Experimental & Honnest poetry: In this experimental album, B̩langer shows his own dark & hidden garden. Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album (Rver Mieux - wich totally impressed me), he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight (analogy: boxe). All songs bearing numbers instead of titles, he lets listners use their intelligence & imagination in order to ""feel"" the music his own way.One of the most impressive album from Quebec this year.I give 5 stars and two thumbs up."
1,"Nineteen folktales of South and Central America: This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
1,"This book is incomprehensible: This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all!"
1,"It wasn't very good!: This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."
1,"Very boring: I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book."
1,"on order: I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait."
2,"Long torso but great product: Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1"". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised."
2,"Love This Item: I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all. I do suggest finding your correct size, not the size you think you are. The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape. It flattens your middle so your blouses, tshirts and dresses look much nicer."
2,"Had some problems at first but now i love it: I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer."
2,"Good choice for getting a vintage look: I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."
2,"Squeem works well: I am pleased with this item. It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso, but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well. It is rubbery, so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires."
1,"Too small - NO RETURNS: I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size...when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small.........AND THERE IS NO REFUND.....So I didn't wear it or use it....and I am out $35.00 plus....for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for....one I could wear and use...will not buy from this seller again"
2,"wow: this product does exactly what it says it does! the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on. the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier!! Don't give up it is worth it!"
2,"Great!: I enjoyed this waist cincher! it corrects my posture, and makes me look slimmer!However, I think it stretched out a bit... Or I lost some inches!"
1,"Wasn't what I expected: I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point."
2,"great: provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it (I ordered a size small). The size chart is very accurate, it fits like a glove."
2,"a good smoother: I do believe this product is very good but, in my case, the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything. I am already petite, so the cincher doesn't significantly reduce my waistline. It does, however, make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like. You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product. It is a very good and very cool cincher. I think it can even be worn on top of clothing, for a goth or fetish look. It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you."
2,"Works Well!: I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I ""tried out"" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me ""back fat"" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two ""size options"" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your ""natural"" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my ""under/side boob"" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)"
2,"squeem cincher: Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone."
1,"not really worth it: I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better."
2,"Great product; great seller!: I got this item within a few days of my purchase. It is exactly what I wanted -- I look a whole size smaller, instantly. I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love, but they were asking almost $200 for it! I highly recommend this item and the seller."
1,"Painful Experience: I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible."
2,"Great Product!: Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture. It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down. I've been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone. Of course, you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money."
1,"poor fit: After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."
1,"Not recommended!: When I received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. There's no way I would recommend this to anyone. There are definitely other products on the market that do the job!!"
1,"Gave me a waist, but just pushed my fat around: The product did what it was ""supposed to"" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd."
1,"Advertized as ""New"" but arrives worn out: Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging (with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn). The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material. All three were advertized as ""New"" on Amazon site. Before you decide to buy new item, beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn (if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover). These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as ""New"""
2,"Great results, with some side effects...: I have one of those ""spare tire"" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to ""make"" me look trimmer..."
2,"Perfect for getting rid of pesky love handles: Typically I wear a medium adult women's sized shirt and a large in juniors- and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :).This really works, well too- sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want/need.The one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle (if you have some curve to you) and I'm not sure how to get it stretched out again.However, overall- if it didn't bunch up- I would give it 5 stars :)"
1,"Upset: I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down..."
1,"Falling apart: When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to ""right-sized"" eating (whereas a lot of times I would get seconds, I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving), which of course is wonderful. I didn't mind that sometimes it bunched up, I didn't mind that sometimes it left welts (that went away shortly after I removed the cincher), however, after about two weeks, on of the metal prongs came out, making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn't hold it's form. Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost."
2,"ahi: I am 116 lbs. but after 4 kids (a set of twins) the tummy was not the same. squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes...never look better. the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat..after its off all the bulge comes out. It makes you look great thou...don't leave home without it."
1,"Incrediby difficult to put on: With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks."
1,"Squeem: I ordered according to the size chart for my measurements and it was way to small!! Very uncomfortable.I returned it,"
2,"A bit uncomfortable...: I had to exchange the size but the small is still _really small_. It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium. I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss. It's tedious to put on and I'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked! There has to be an easier way! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while. I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind. The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little. Should you buy it? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs, then go for it. It was inexpensive."
2,"This is the one: I'm fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me, with no problem. I love that you can't see it under clothes. I notice my back feel better with it on, my posture improves, and I look good in my clothes. I love this!"
2,"really love it.: Does the job and I feel the tightness. Thanks for making a change that is a big difference for me. I would recommed others to buy it."
2,"Wow!: All and all this is a very nice product. It really holds in those unwanted mid life bulges and it looks smooth under your clothing. It sort of helps your posture when sitting at a computer for very long hours. The inner cotton lining feels nice against the skin and it appears to move moisture,although not totally, away from your skin. Now mind you it is pure rubber, yes I said rubber, so make sure you wash it thoroughly, also it will take two days to air dry.I brought one with straps and bought the strapless one from Amazon......much cheaper than a boutique.Cher!"
1,"Not the shape I was going for....: I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions, trying a large, medium and small as my size changed after having twins. Unfortunately, I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on. I don't know why I kept trying aside from desperation. It just gave me a very weird shape. Sure, it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top. I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my ""excess"" down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse. I'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it's just my body type that is the problem. I have a long torso at 5'10 and 140lbs. Great product in concept but didn't work at all for me."
1,"Bones: This product does suck you in Great !! But the bones in here tore back back up, I had all kinds of bruising when I took this off after wearing it all day, they need to make one smooth with out the bones."
2,"Magic: After 3 c sections, I need all the help I can get. I started with the size Large (when I was a size 12). I have moved on to the medium (I am between 8-10 now). The medium is REALLY tight, but does the job. I prefer the large day to day because I have 3 children under 6 to run after, and it is a bit more comfortable for that. These things are really great. I can't believe I didn't know about them after my first 2 c sections. They should send all women home with them after giving birth!"
1,"Wrong item shipped!!!!!: I ordered this waist cincher specifically to wear on my wedding day with my beautiful sleeveless dress. Unfortunately, they shipped the WRONG thing, and now I am stuck with a big, bulky and hideous vest! It has very ugly racerback straps, and I will definitely not be able to wear this under my dress. And the worst part, I'm out the money! I can't even return it for a refund, even though I haven't opened the box. VERY disappointed in this company. Buyer beware!"
1,"Sizing is Ridiculous: I measure as a Small and the Small and Medium did NOT fit. Update: I ordered a Large and wore it for 2 days and it stretched too much. I am not sure this will help, but I have worn the item so I cannot return the Large. I am not any smaller than when I began so the Large did stretch and did not shrink my waist and/or hips."
1,"So what is the sizing?: I ordered a 3X, because that's the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing....so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x...seemed extreme, but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange, I'll say that....However, when the 5X arrived, it's so big it just gaps and falls off? So, was the 3X mislabeled, or is this 5x mislabeled? I'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care....so I really don't know what to do at this point?"
1,"Causes sweat that makes it unwearable!: This corset makes me Sweat like a hog, I am not I'm a petite woman just looking for structure to maintain a flat stomach. Theres no doubt it gave me a fantastic shape, was flawlessly discreet under my clothes but I was forced to stop wearing it, because by the end of the day it was very uncomfortable, hot and sweaty underneath. This was bad for my skin too, it made it dry and would have gotten red and irritated if I kept wearing it and for longer periods. It got to the point where it was pointless to wear because the was no breathing for my skin underneath it and I'd want to take it off immediately, so I never wore it, and just gave up and returned it. Still looking for a perfect corset, this however is NOT it. Don't waste your time."
2,"best money I ever spent on shape wear: I received mine today and I squeeled with delight when I heard the door bell ringing for delivery. I immediately put it on. It does take some muscle power..but no where as hard as I was expecting to get it on. It sucks, tucks and hold!!!!! My S/O was giving me the side eye..he didnt get my excitement , this was just another one of my many purchases. BUT!!! But ladies and gentlemen ***for the man who is looking to buy a gift their lady will love** when I started trying on my dresses he exclaimed ""WOW!! it does take off a few inches of the waist""...I love it. I have been walking around the apartment in it and I have been sitting and standing with no problems. Well it does force you to sit upright. Which is great!..small waist and fabulous posture...I can't complain. I am loving my squeem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"works great: Bought it 3 months after pregnancy with twins. I had gone down to my pre-pregnancy weight but my tummy was still not firm. Used the belt and reduced the waist to pre-pregnancy size after wearing it 8 times."
1,"Great at first...not so good over time: Perhaps I got a bad one? A factory second? For the first 3-4 days I wore mine, it was great, just as advertised, helped me fit into those pants that are just a tiny bit too snug around the waist. I was very happy and it helped me concentrate on my posture, too, although it was very difficult to turn in the car seat when backing out of a parking space! However, I put it on today, and while my left side is all smooth and nicely held in, the support thing (bone or whatever) under my right breast seems to have lost all its firmness. My entire right front is pushing outwards on that, making a vertical bulge; whereas my left side is still firm and compressed. I don't know what could be happening."
2,"Recommend this: I used this product 19 years ago after my pregancy while working out and getting back to shape. I had a slimmer waist within weeks. You tend to sweat and lose inches having this on. It is a bit uncomfortable at first and it takes getting used to, but I would wear it only while working out. Otherwise, I would take it off.19 years later, after having my second child, I was looking for the same waist cincher which I just received and began working out with it. I am a firm believer this will bring my waist to where I was prior being pregnant with my workouts. It is well made and sturdy. The metal hooks never pinch nor they unhook while doing exercising. I recommend this product."
1,"boning is not a plus: It holds things together but the boning gets uncomfortable, would have been better without it. It also folds in with the fold of my stomach, which I didn't want, so it doesn't get that pooch area as well as I would've liked. I guess if you just want to tuck things in to wear a dress this would be good, thats about it."
1,"Pass: The Sizes run really small, It flips up even though, they said it would not and the hooks don't hold. I am very dissapointed."
2,"Love this!: I'm training my waist to lose inches. I used to always buy fajas which are very uncomfortable and takes alot of getting used to. I wear them most of the day and throughout the night. This one is more comfortable (as something squeezing u can be) and looks good under certain clothes. I like that the inside is a rubbery material that helps u sweat. It speeds up the weight loss process. I plan to buy the next size down soon because my waist has already shrank! I probably will buy the one with the straps next time because the strapless does kinda push ur back fat up and with certain clothes you can see it. All in all it's a great product and the most comfortable cincher I've ever bought."
1,"Poor quality: I purchased this item to wear postpartum. I love how it fits and how well it smooths things out post baby. The major downside to this is the poor quality. The eye portion of about five of the hook/eye closures has come out entirely. I know that this is not a sizing issue because I followed the sizing for the product and it's only select ones that appear to not have been sewn as well as the rest. Very disappointing for what would have otherwise been an awesome product that I could recommend to others, to instead be a waste of my money!"
2,"Squeem Perfect Waist, Firm compression: I'm a 100% satisfied with the Squeem Magical Lingerie Shapewear. It delivers what it promises, everything that describes the product it's true. It reduces about 2 inches instantly, it hardly shows with thin clothes, it doesn't let me eat a lot and I feel full the rest of the day, It recommends to wear it about 8 hours but I can even sleep with it, the only thing is that I get marks like when wearing thigh socks, it gives me a smaller waist than what the picture shows, and it's the perfect length for my core.I'm 5'3, I tried another brand before but it was too long for me, I could feel the wires poking specially when bending down. I recommend to measure yourself before ordering any brand.Once I get used to this one, I'm planning to order the ""Extra firm compression"". It gives more back support and it will reduce the waist even more!"
1,"Not the best shaper: This would be great if it had boning in it. I am not sure if this os because i have a very pronounced hour glass figure, but when I put it on, the fabric slides the the waist and it has the same effect as if I had a rubber band aroun my waist, forming a bulge above and below my waist. Too bad- I had hoped this would work based on reviews."
1,"It works, BUT....: My size medium was true to size. This made my waist smaller and while I had it on, I didn't eat as much because of the pressure, it makes me feel full; however, all of the cinchers do this as it is its purpose. I did like the fact that it's shorter from the lower back and a bit longer on the tummy... BUTTT... a HUGE BUT for me... What I didn't like was that it made big bulges of fat on my upper back (eewww!)... and I don't even have back fat!!! So to me this defeats the whole purpose! All it did was cover my stomach fat but GAVE me back fat!!! Also, what's going on with the price increase?? I just bought this 3 weeks ago for $30, now it's $45!"
2,"squeem: I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores"
1,"Product defective after 1 day of use: The product overall was comfortable and did shape nicely. The problem is that after only 1 day of wearing the product was bunched at the waist and the interior supports were bent without repair. I contacted the company and they did say I had the correct size and to wear a tank under the Squeem to help with bunching. This didn't help the bent supports and I returned the product."
2,"a great buy!: after baby #2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible. I am so glad that I bought the squeem, it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape. I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldn't believe that I had just had a baby. Now that I am 7 months postpartum, I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support. It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before!"
1,"No,No,No This is not for me.....: I own the vest squeem and I absolutely love it!!!!! But this waist cincher is not for me. I'm not gonna say don't buy it because alot of women are shaped different.I just got it yesterday and I'm sending it back. It fit well until my back fat overlapsed over the top of the cincher and thats not attractive at all. So if you know you have more than enough back fat, this is not for you. I tried to adjust it by pulling it up or down and that didnt even help. I wear a size medium, so its my correct size. But it doesnt give me the full coverage support that the vest gives me. The vest covers all the back fat and everything. But I still give Squeem thumbs up though!!! :-)"
2,"Can't Go Wrong With This Item!: I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. As far as the smell, it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies, so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day. The same thing with the waist cincher, the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall, great product."
1,"Would be great but...: The package says it goes from lower belly to just under bust. I am a short woman and it doesn't reach my ribs leaving me with two huge rolls of fat on the front and back. It takes me in great, love that about it but because it isn't long enough I can't wear it anywhere:("
1,"works but uncomfortable: Held my tummy in when I tried it on but was way too stiff...the boning and the hooks showed through, so could not even wear it inside a tshirt. Was tough to wear and I was scared of pinching myself while wearing it"
1,"Major let down!: I bought this product based on the positive reviews. I wish I hadn't bought this waist cincher. The bottom of the cincher ends in a weird triangle, which goes about 4 inches on my thigh, the bottom wrinkles up and looks ugly, it is extremely visible under a normal t-shirt, and it looks TERRIBLE if you sit down while wearing it. This looks decent (barely) when you're standing up, and you might as not wear it if you ever need to sit down. The length is way off, it goes 4 inches down to my thigh and up to an inch from my armpits. I'm 5'3 and weight 125 lbs. This looks terrible and I'm sending it back the same day it was delivered. Save your money."
2,"Awsome!!: Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i'm still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :) really i recomended. Money well spend it"
1,"Wasnt worth: I bought a pink rubber squeem which had a seperate cotton cloth . That worked well, but i wonder why i dint buy the same and ended up with this. This product hurts me on my left hip and i got scars on my left hip.. :("
2,"GREAT THERAPEUTICALLY AS WELL AS GREAT FOR FASHION!!!: I had two reasons for the purchase of this product, one was for my spine difficulties thanks to a severe injury many years ago & the other was pure vanity! But it has surpassed my expectations for both reasons! It is ever so comfortable and makes me look great so I feel beautiful!!! I just cannot express in words how great this product is!!!"
1,"Not so much: Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service."
1,"Burn Rubber on Me: I went by the Squeem chart and my waist measurements to find the correct size but to my suprise the waist cincher did not fit. Warning, you cannot return for a refund; only merchandise credit/exchange. Also, the cincher smelled like burnt rubber. Very bulky and will be visible through clothing so you cannot wear with tight fitting clothing."
1,"Not worth the price...: I bought this to slim down my tummy under a bridesmaid dress. First, it smelled horrific and still stunk like rubber after washing. Second, it did almost nothing to slim me down, even though I bought the suggested size. Third, after about a half hour of wearing it, it was absorbing sweat and making me feel clammy and uncomfortable. It was extremely uncomfortable to sit down in, and the boning showed through the relatively thick cotton of the dress. I abandoned it completely and felt much better."
1,"Torture: Too tight,wanted to help me get back in shape after my baby, couldn't even close the whole thing!Returned it ASAP"
1,"Squeem: The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply."
2,"I'm very impressed so far: So I just got mine today and I put it on right out of the box. Like some have said, takes a few minutes to get used to it. I've been wearing it for 5 hours now and I just love it. It covers everything that needs to be covered (and I am long-waisted). It stays put, which I love. It's comfortable. It makes my waist look great and flattens my stomach ""pooch"". It's comfortable enough to sit in. Best of all, instant posture makeover and it is easing my lower back pain by providing support. I'm looking forward to wearing this for a long time and already foresee a black one in my future. I wonder if I can wear it on my runs? Hmmm... Also: I have a size 31 inch waist and the medium fits perfect on the first loops. Just take your measurements before you order. Hopefully, as I lose weight (from my running/training program) I can cinch it to the tighter loops and get a little more use out of it. Well... then I'll just have to get a size small! I love it!"
2,"Not for everyone: I was really excited to try this, however it is not for everyone. I have a ""flat"" stomach just flabby and then I have ""love handles"" so I thought this would just hold everything in but that's not how it worked for me. It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didn't have before. It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front. I think I would rather have the love handles. I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts. (Not exactly why I bought it but o well). I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me, just not how I thought it would."
2,"Squeem:> A Combination of Scream and Squeeze?: I first ordered size X-L, but that was too big, so I returned it and bought a L. The first couple of wearings were difficult, but then the product becomes slightly stretched and begins to conform slightly to your body. I do wear a stretchy tube underneath it (sort of like the top part of panty hose). I try to wear it while I am standing or walking around. It is not comfortable to wear while sitting. For me, I think it would be more comfortable if it were about one inch shorter, as I think my torso is shorter than most. I do think it is helping, but I need to wear it for more hours. I am thinking of wearing it while I sleep, rather than in the daytime, but I have not tried that yet. The product is well made."
2,"excelent product!: This product does what is said in the description, my waist got smaller and I can stand for hours withoutfeeling any pain on my back. My work requires a lot of lifting this product help protect my back. I love it! Is my second buy. The price is also good, the first one I got cost me $55 this time I paid $36 for it."
1,"Hard to put on: The shape wear is difficult to put on and you can see the seams through your clothes. It is hard to bend over, especially as a school teacher! I would definitely like to try Brooke Burke's Belly Taut instead of this old school shapewear!"
1,"Why does everybody rave when....: This product sucks!It doesn't completely suck... the 2 days I was able to wear it before the boning snapped in half it did compress pretty tight. As many people have noted, it is HELL to get into this the first time.I liked that this wasn't a body suit and the rubber on the outside would keep my shirt from sliding up.BUTThis garment:1) Rides up- if you move a lot it will eventually slide up your waist2) Leaves a huge crease on the skin above your waist-- and it hurts3) Makes you look like a sausage when you sit down: visually divides your belly in half when you sitAs I said I only wore this twice, first time I wore it for about half hour and the second time I had worn it for several hours when the boning snapped in half and was poking into my side (ouch!! )RETURNING THIS!!!"
1,"Uncomfortable!: It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50.."
1,"Great idea, poor design: This shape-wear is the best I've had until now regarding easiness to wear and put-on. It does a great job at keeping the post-pregnancy flabby belly under control. However, after about 2 months of daily use, the metal that gives the support is coming out from the fabric. It seems that the metal is rubbing out the fabric and thins it enough to come out. I wish there was a better designed support for this binder. Otherwise, it is awesome - good looking for such lingerie. So, if you buy it, expect 2 months of wearing it without problems..."
2,"best shapewear: it the best shapewear says what it does everyone ask how you look so small bought 3 for friends loveit"
1,"Waste of time for me: I really wanted this item to work because everybody seemed to love it. It didn't hold anything in on me and it gave me back boobs. Waste of money for me."
1,"Not OK!!!: When I ordered this I thought it would allow me to wear some clothes that I haven't been able to do in a while because of my weight gain.I am a woman who has size 40D in breasts so I wear a large in tops and I wear a size 8 in pants, and weight 140lbs. It is suppose to clinch your waist and give you a nice looking figure. Well, it did hug my waist, but it also gave my a muffin top. Not a shape a woman wants to have. I looked better without wearing it. It folds into your folds creating a bigger fold at the top of your body. I would say this item is more for the extremely skinny female who has small breasts', no hips, or ass. Not for a woman who has large breast, hips, and ass. Not for women who are going through post-pregnancy either. For a product thats is suppose to make you feel good about yourself, it failed."
1,"Not worth the pain it causes: Squeem Shapewear definitely does the job of sucking you in. However, I found that the rods painfully poked me on the side and ultimately resulted in a wound. Not worth the pain."
2,"I love It!: it does what it is supposed to do making you look slimmer in the waist area. my grandmother even notice it, and she didn't even know i bought it. It really makes you look smaller in that area of your body. I would most likely buy another one but next time in a small not medium."
1,"disappointed: I think this is a case of my expectations being too high. I was so encouraged by the great reviews of this product, I really was expecting a miracle. After only wearing this twice, it is stretched out. At first, I thought perhaps it would regain it's shape after a few hours but nope! It's no better than a cheap, fashion corset. It will smooth things out so there's less bulging under the clothes but I was looking for a real ""waist trainer"", something that would go on tight and STAY tight. Considering I found this product when I searched specifically for ""waist trainer"", I would say the claims of this product are misleading. It is shapewear, it is NOT a ""cincher"" or a ""trainer""."
1,"itchy: I washed it before used it for the first time. The next day I wore it, I found my skin were itchy all over place on my stomach. And I feel that the heat on my body trapped on that."
2,"i love it..: i realy love my shape wear, i got one for myself and one for my daughter and she's notice a big difference,"
2,"Wow, Ow and What's that smell?: I have been using this for 3 weeks now and while I have seen no difference in my measurements, my posture is definitely improved. I have also lost about 6 pounds, which is likely due to my combination of diet and exercise, but I have also been wearing the corset at least 4 days a week for up to 9 hours at a time.I am 5'9"" 150 pounds and I bought a size Small and it fits how it should, super tight. I look forward to eventually going in to the second hooks.My only complaint is the SMELL. It smells like rubber and while I hope no one around me really notices, I notice. I wear a wrap around my midsection underneath it, but after all day the smell still gets on and stays on my skin.Otherwise, the construction is super sturdy and I anticipate only needed one for a long time. Hopefully the smell will fade with more hand washes..."
2,"squeem is pretty good: i have a 28-29 inch waist normally. should've started with a size Small. the XS seemed a bit smaller than described. definitely gets the job done in cinching the waist!"
2,"Snug Fit: Great product for giving you that snug fit...it does become very uncomfortable around the waist line if worn to long. I really do like this item, the only BIG issue I have is the fact that you can see the snaps through your clothing...so I suggest not wearing this with a tight fitting dress or shirt, because everyone will know your secret!"
1,"Poor quality and lousy customer service: The Squeem is a great idea, but their quality is second rate, and their customer service is worse than useless. I'd owned mine for about 4 weeks and worn it only a few hours a day when I noticed that a seam was coming unstitched. The threads aren't frayed; they're unstitching from the seam.Contacting customer service has been an exercise in futility. They've asked for pictures of the damage, and then failed to respond to the pictures, or any further attempts to contact them.For what this costs, it needs to last longer than 4 weeks."
1,"IN THE TRASH IT GOES!!!!!: Hello! I am a woman nearing my 60s, and my waist certainly isn't getting any smaller! I purchased this product in the hopes that it would shrink my ever-growing belly. To accommodate for my girth, I bought the Squeem ""Magical"" Lingerie Shapewear in XXXXX-Large, the largest size available. WELL, here's a bit of magic for ya, sisters. The second I snapped the first two hooks together, the tightness was unbearable. It felt like it was squeezing my waist fat straight down to my giant ass. Fortunately, the discomfort didn't last long, since the hooks flew off and therefore ruined the Squeem altogether. These things need to come in larger sizes. Not even worthy of 1 star. More worthy of steaming diarrhea."
2,"Very sturdy: This item is very sturdy and holds in the belly area better than another softer belt I have. The measurements seem true to size and there are two rows of hooks so you can adjust if you lose some weight.The only negative points are that the item smells badly of rubber when new. It must be washed before wearing. The other is that all that rubber can make you sweat. But those are minor complaints if you want to look good for an evening. The belt also helps me sit straight so I think it's good for the back as well as the front."
1,"Worked for 5 days then broke: I liked how it pulled everything in! I felt fantastic for about 2 hours. it really flattens the tummy area, which is all I really want, but you can see the hooks threw clothes :( I felt like that ruined it for me, also I had to keep pulling it up. It bunches in the back, and really smells like rubber. After about 5 or 6 days one of the ""bones"" on the inside broke and was stabbing me in the side! it really hurt. I would not recommend this product."
2,"does its job: recommend itit really slim out my waist line clearly cleanly.hope i could buy it in beige color. could be little cheaper"
2,"Squeem: Love this product. I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss. It is true to size."
2,"So Far So Good!: I've only worn this for a day so far, but I love it! I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago. This really holds you in, its comfortable and I don't think it shows through your clothes! I highly recommend!!"
2,"Makes me look like a i have a perfect hourglass figure: I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone."
2,"simple quick fix: I bought this product to slim my waist and I really didn't have big expectations for it at all. I figured I'd wear it under my clothes for a more defined shape. I've been wearing it for a month already and I've seen my waist go down 2 inches! I wear it all day at work from 7:00 till about 3:00. It fit snug in the beginning but after one week I had to go to the tighter hooks and even that is too big now and I may need to buy a small. I actually like wearing it but I recommend wearing a tank top under it because it will start to press into your skin and kind of make you sore ( hence the 4 star rating). I'm very happy with this product for the price. It works better than Spanx."
2,"A must have...: This is a must have if you desire a smooth look in shirts and dresses. It also offers great support for your back. It is perfect for everyday wear."
2,"The squeem waist cincher: The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I'll get two of them"
1,"Wasn't that impressed........: It didn't do much to slim the midsection and all it does is pretty much push everything up to the top, making your breasts and back look MUCH wider. If I do continue to wear it, it will be around the house or under loose clothes/jackets."
2,"Squeeeeeze into your clothes: I really liked the Squeem. I'm a petite person, but have some love handles that I need to hide when I'm wearing tight clothes. The only problem is that it has boning which you feel in your ribs when it's tight."
2,"Love it: This works really well. I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months post-partum. It's still a bit separated but this definitely helped. I wish I knew about it sooner. It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it. Great to wear during exercise, again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward. Also, it looks hot! And sometimes I wear it out. I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time. Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur. 27"" waist before pregnancy, 30"" waist when I bought a size medium, 28"" now, and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted..."
2,"Good product: I read the reviews for this product and purchased. I am an Ardyss wearer and after that brand this one is a piece of cake. I purchased a small but need an extra small because I can wear it all day comfortably. For me if I don't feel a slight discomfort in the beginning I don't feel it's working. The thing I like the most about it is that's it's strapless and can be worn with almost any type of top. Body hugging tops excluded, of course. I recommend it if you want to go extra sexy for a night on the town."
1,"Waste of money: The product worked fine on the first day and now it doesn't work as described on the advert. I've never been so sore (both side) in my entire life. I cannot wear it for more than 2h. Other then the product itself, the delivery system was also misleading I choose a 5-8 days delivery when i placed the order but the product was delivered a month later. What made me even more annoyed was the fact that I had to pay for the post charges because apparently the sender didn't use correct stamp or pay the full charge. :@"
1,"I got burned after few hours wearing it: the first day,( 8 hours wearing it ) it hurt me so bad , my skin was torned, itched, swell, deep red. I tried to wear other side, after few hours, I got deep burned both on the right and left belly, the skin was torned, swell, bleeding, lot of cross cut on the skin, itched for a week until now. It looked like I was beaten up or have skin disease...I am scared to dead when I look at it now. I don't know why I got it , I used something like this before, but I didn't get any bad thing. or the rubber hurt me ?"
1,"does not fit me!: So according to the size chart on the box size small is for waistline 28-31my waist is 28 so i got the smallit does not even come close to being able to close and clasp!maybe it's just me but i am terribly disappointed"
1,"Bulky, feels gross, not worth ordering: I read up on belly-wrapping after my c-section and bought a couple compression tank-tops from Wal-Mart, which worked nicely. I wanted something without straps and something with more compression and purchased the Squeem Perfect Waist on Amazon after reading rave reviews. When I received it and tried it on, it felt disgusting on my skin. It was uncomfortable and totally noticeable (even without a super-tight or thin shirt on), especially when I sat down. The seams and the boning are all very noticeable, and the rubber makes clothes catch and stick in a really weird way, like something would stick to you if you were really sweaty. I have wore corsets for years, and this is by far the grossest feeling and least comfortable thing I have ever put on my body. I returned it immediately."
1,"Caused damage to my stomach muscles!: Felt great until it dug into my waist while sitting causing damage to my surgical site. Now I'm in pain with and without it on."
2,"Great product: Just what I needed to get me headed back toward my pre-pregnancy waist. Bought an XL and probably could have fit into the large. Looking to down size soon!"
2,"Great product: Great fit. Does exactly what it is suppose to. Plan to buy more in different colors. Sent in good order."
2,"Love it!!: It was everything it was advertised to be. I'm going to get another one!!! Got so many compliments at the party that I wore it to. Made my outfit look really great!!"
2,"very good: this product is awesome. it hide all your secrets. I would recommend this product to all women and men. I will buy product again."
2,"It worked for me..: Thought this was not going to fit because I am a 44"" currently and I only ordered XL.. Like it very much"
1,"Not what I expected: This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx."
1,"Too small: Usually a size XS to S but this girdle's small did not fit true to size. Had to return back to Amazon."
2,"perfect: Got this so I could start performing again(drag queen)and have put on a few pounds around the mid area, I didn't want to lose the eaight because i would lose my rear but all I want to do was lose the tummy. Had to have a friend help me put it on at first but wore it all day then half way through the day we went to the second latch and gave me the form I needed to fit back into my outfits, Works great and like they say pain is beauty, and this is so worth it."
2,"AMAZING: I waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing, trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone!"
2,"Its amazing!!!: It really works! I am in love. I was trying to get my pre-pregnancy 21 in waist back for 10 months now. I got to 23in and kind of got stuck there. With Squeem I went from 23 in waist to 21in in just 2 minutes! Start hooking it from the top, much easier. Buy it! You won't regret!"
1,"Awesome!: It's pretty awesome for such a price! It definitely gives you great posture, I was sitting up straight like no other! although i wish they could improve on the rubber smell otherwise it's wonderful!^^^^^ was my review when i had it for 15-20 days, now-- after ordering it on Jan, 21, 2012-- it's SO useless. I've washed it with care, it smells like rubber, and it's pretty nasty. I'd rather pay $$$ and buy something that works the way it should."
1,"Fall apart: I don't understand why these inserts are made up from 2 pieces. It should just be one piece. The 2 pieces are held together with a small piece of double sided tape and COMPLETELY fall apart after 1 day of walking. No problem with seller, this is just a HORRIBLY made product."
2,"Awesome!: This CD is amazing. I am very sad that 107.7 The X in Birmingham is no longer. They made a great CD to benefit a great cause."
2,"Janes All the worlds aircraft 1996-7: Great to deal with. Very quick delivery. Very highly recommended. Thank you."
2,"Marie Antoinette -- What A Doll!: You've read the books, you've seen the movie, you coveted the necklace... Now what?Well, of course, Marie must come to live with you so that you can eat that cake together!Prepare to lose your head over lovely Marie!"
1,"Dont order them in white or any light color: We have owed these plates in white for quite some years. maybe six or more. I just replaced all of them with a set from Crate and Barrell. They are heavy and seemingly well made but they have been faulty in a a number of ways. First my biggest complaint is on the white plates everytime you happen to scrape them with silverware it leaves a permanent mark. Never wash anything stainless near them in the diawasher since it will mark it up there as well if it rubs up against them. After years of use they looked horrible with marks all over them. They also seemed to chip very easily. So between the chips and marks all over them I couldn't take looking at them anymore. They also are not good in the microwave. They get very hot and the food not so much. I would not recommend for everyday use. Maybe the dark colors would show less marks but if they chip it will be very noticable. My advice is to purchase bone china or porcelain. I will never buy these again."
1,"This is Disgusting: The German Pinscher is a wonderful Family pet and this type of comments makes them sound dangerous. I own 3 German Pinschers and they are wonderful pets. I resent this type of product."
2,"Happy yet Dissapointed: I was amost completely happy with this soundtrack. What upsets me is that there was on particular track from the game that I loved, and it was because of this track that i payed for this c.d. It was upsetting to find that this c.d. contained every song from the game except for the one that influenced me to buy it in the first place."
2,"Legend of Dragoon Soundtrack: This soundtrack is amazing. It has all the songs you want to hear most though it doesn't have all the songs. I've played the Legend of Dragoon for a very long time. It's a great game and you really notice the music once you hear it on the soundtrack. Amazing game and music.I highly recommend it,Logan"
1,"I just wanted Jimmy Ponder (too little guitar on this one): I couldn't wait to get this CD,being a guitarist myself. Just give me straight Jimmy Ponder, not horns and other ""jazz types"". I am disappointed. Cuts two and four are the best. They are Jimmy. Too bad I couldn't have listened to cuts first, I would not have bought this CD. Sorry! The cuts of just Jimmy are great though, but too few .... :("
1,"Horrible: This movie was horrible. It did not play right when I was watching it online. I liked how it went by old vampire styles. Such as crosses worked and you had to invite them in and such. But the ending was really bad. Do not waste your money on this one. Also the storyline did not really make much sense."
1,"Negative Stars! Avoid like flesh eating bacteria!: ""Lets jiggel the camera to show that the ground is shakeing!""Special effects; haloween leftovers.Acting; Well, the cast managed to repeat memorized lines.Casting apears to have been done in a trailer park.Script; I know nine year olds who write better stories.Cinimatography; Someones home cam.Conclusion: Anoyingly boreing and essentially unwatchable waist of time and money."
1,"Worst movie EVER!!!!: Do not waste your time! I love hokie, I love cheese when it comes to horror. This just plain old sucked."
1,"meh: There was very bad effects & evil characters that look like they stepped out of the 10 dollar costume halloween shop. If you are in to paying 1.99 for really cheesy stuff this is for you. The bad guy does have a good demonic voice & some interestingly complex and incredibly vulgar sayings."
2,"Religion and profits: An excellent scholarly book. Great detail and very in depth analysis. Inevitable conclusion is the impossibility of molding an economic system out of a moral philosophy, not just Islam. That is where the problem with traditional Islamic thought arises, for most of its adherents, Islam is not just a set of moral principles but a way of life, dictating every aspect of it. Unavoidably, there was much effort by Islamists to set up a distinct system of banking and economy based on pure Islamic traditions. Prof. Kuran delves into the history of these movements, but he does more than that, he puts all this in cultural and political context. At the end, he bravely expands more on the general failure of Islamic culture and tradition to bring wealth and prosperity to the masses that follow it. Writing is very formal, not the easiest read and surley apporpriate only for the truly intersted in the general topic, but it was well worth it for this reader."
2,"Ten gold bananas for Gorilla: Ten gold bananas, two thumbs up and hurrah for Gorilla! What a wonderful book. It was a pleasure to read! If you just want to get comfortable and enjoy a book-this is the one I would suggest."
2,"The ending was great!: The most unusual story of a young man facing life with a handicap. I felt like a cheerleader and prayed that he could overcome. I could hardly wait to reach the end of the book. Don't peek!"
2,"Finally on CD: I have this still on vinyl! it's great to see it out there on CD( even if its an import)! ""Super Strut"" and ""Rhapsody in Blue"" alone are worth it! One of the ""must haves "" for a collection of '70s jazz. Caan we get the rest of the CTI Catalog back out there???Please?"
1,"WARNING: This is the worst book ever written: As most people readers know, Jack Higgins has written many fine action-packed books. However, this book reads like a twelve-year-old wrote it. The characters are so transparent they could be ghosts.The author and his publishing house must really need the money to rip of the public in this manner. This is the last book I read by this author. One can only rest on his laurels for so long. I'm glad this book was handed down to me or I would have written a really nasty review."
1,"Edge of Danger: Somebody from higher places should have stopped Mr. Higgins and the publisher from putting this book on the market.It��s quite disturbing to see the absence of integrity and sense of responsibility in providing a joy of reading to the public.All along, I had fight off the growing urge of disposing this disastrous novel only because the shipping charge cost more than the book itself.Yet, once I overcame my frustration and finished the book, I regretted not heeding to my senses.It��s obvious that Mr. Higgins had no heart in writing this book, and he made no effort in showing creativity with words.I was about to scream my head off when he kept rehashing the same phrases (e.g., browning with carswell silencer) over and over again in every single chapter!!This book made me a true anti-Higgins...."
1,"Edge of Danger: 1 star - only because that's the minimum.This book proves the famous can publish anything."
1,"Actually, this book is not worth one star.: This is my very first book review. Because this book is so fundamentally wrong I need to speak up. The main character Sean Dillion, formal IRA, has a license to kill and make the killing like a game rather than justice. He does whatever he wants to do without follow orders nor has any boundary. He pickup a couple of his terrorism/criminal partners making killing like a habits, terrorism competition, fun game and egoism fulfillment. It so far from any common sense such as the British General could not control this maniacal killer and let he kills who he wish to kill or threaten his masculinity. The killings like a joke to him and have absolutely no legal consequence. This book has promote violence behavior has no artist nor entertainment value. I lost my interest in Jack Higgins Sean Dillion's serial after finishing this ridicules book."
1,"Not Worth The Reader's Time: It's a hard slog to read a book written by someone just going through the motions.Jack Higgins drags out his stock company of characters - Sean Dillon and his .22 in an ankle holster and glasses of Bushmills and cardboard villians and it's just a bore.The action isn't believable. The plot is silly. The dialogue is written to tell the reader what's going on (and every character speaks with the same voice) - this isn't how real people speak. Then the characters overexplain because, apparently, the author wasn't paying attention when he gave you the same information a dozen or so pages ago.Frankly, I've read enough about the IRA and Prods and One Para and County Down to last me the rest of my born days. It just isn't worth it anymore, Jack. Too much work reading for too little reward."
1,"Disappointing and too simplistic: This minimalism style of writing exposes too much reliance on characters and events from previous books with little descriptive detail of some promising locations. The action is thin as well, characters die frequently and quickly with little build up or detail. Character motivation is weak at times and contributes to an arid experience with a predictable climax."
1,"Worst Book I've Ever Read: This is simply the worst book I remember reading. I enjoyed a couple other Jack Higgins novels, so I happily picked this up. I'm sorry I did. It is nothing but action, which might be OK for a fun read on the beach, but even the action is so poorly written it is ridiculous. Massive action scenes (such as large battles) take place in only 1 or 2 pages. There's no character development, poor dialogue, no setting descriptions, no drama or suspense -- nothing but a poorly-described series of ""events""! Enough said."
1,"Formula Writing: I have been a Higgins fan for many years, and have read and collected almost all of the books he has written. Some were great and full of suspense. But the last three he has written, including this one, ""Edge of Danger"", are very disappointing. He has resorted to producing 2 books a year, based on the formula of a superficial story line with no depth, predictable characters, and it seems that he now writes just to capitalize on his prior reputation as a good suspense writer.Count the number of Marlboros smoked, the amount of Bushmills and champagne drank, (and in the midst he changes his champagne brand which makes one wonder whether he has received a better commission from one favorite to another), and you find a shallow book. I would save my money on this one, and buy it only if you collect Higgins First Editions, hoping to capitalize someday on the commercial side of selling all Higgins books to a collector."
1,"Edge of Danger by Jack Higgins: I was a big fan of Jack Higgins adventures until this book! I think this book reads like a poorly written condensed version of a good story - or like the outline of a book. It jumped around too abruptly with poorly written dialogue - no conversation was stretched into a normal length of exchange between people. It was difficult to keep track of all the minor characters in the book because none of them were well developed. I will proabably never read another Jack Higgins book. I am very disappointed - just like I got with Robert Ludlum in one of his later novels. I have never read another book of his either."
1,"Worst of theYear...or, maybe the decade: Where did the real Jack Higgins go? This is not only Higgin's worst effort to date, it is probably the worst book I've read in the past 5 years. (Can you say 'lazy', Jack?)I can't believe I actually finished it, and one star is a generous rating. Unbelievable chapter after unbelievable chapter, no character or plot development, written like a 5th grader.The end of the book foretells a sequel...a book that I will immediately pass on. Probably my last Higgins book without reading the reviews first.Don't buy it -- don't borrow it -- don't read it."
1,"Writing on autopilot: After reading this book, I felt guilty for having purchased it, because that contributed to its best-seller status. (Oops, maybe not; the way it works now, it was a bestseller the day it hit ths stores.) But it is sad to think of all the aspiring writers who struggle to get a publisher's attention for their worthy efforts, while this strangely hollow piece waltzed its way to bestseller status. Some editor should have thrown cold water on this potboiler."
1,"Sophomoric at Best: Having read only one other Higgins book before (Cold Harbor), I hesitate, somewhat, to comment on the author's general talent. However, this book has to be one of the worst I've read in some time. I think the thing that got me the most was the dialog; unbelievably simplistic and totally formulaic. ""Damn, he said to Kate, ""It's the Hazar Scouts, "" Puhleeze! Not even an exclamation mark. Many other examples could be given. Now, assuming for the moment that the dialog was, say, written at greater than a 7th grade level, the plot is almost as bad. The protagonists' reactions to their fellows getting knocked off one-by-one is almost comic. There's no depth here; just one simple vignette after another. I wouldn't even want to compare this to Ludlum or Clancy (although Clancy's gotten a bit rough of late).A terrific waste of a good"
1,"A Waste of Time: This book is not well written and leaves nothing to the imagination. If I hadn't bought it in hard cover and spent the money I would not even have finished reading it."
2,"Plenty of action: This is my second Higgins novel and I am reall getting into this world that has been created by the author. I have learned a lot of the IRA in ways that I find pretty entertaining if at times a little fantastic.The story once again centers around Dillon the bad boy of the IRA that is now working for the British. His mission is to stop this family of half British and half Arab bilionaires.The action is non-stop and pretty interestng. It's a quick read sometime that is to the point and nothing really deep.The only compaint that I have is that I want to know more of Dillon but little by little we are seeing more of the character and some character growth."
1,"Good story- Poor writing: Very simplistic writing style- he said, she said, then he said, then she said. This reads like a first attempt, not like a book written by a seasoned author of over 30 books."
1,"Do I have to give it 1-star?: I've never written a review but my curiosity about what others thought of this book was a thousand times more compelling than the Edge of Danger. I've enjoyed Mr. Higgins' books in the past but can't for the life of me understand a) why he wrote this book, or b) why it was published! There is no plot, no character development, predictable action, no tension. It's like reading an Executive Summary of a book. Are you sure they didn't publish the outline by mistake?"
1,"Disappointment on every page: I'm so glad that this was not my first Jack Higgins novel. If it were, it would also be my last.Normally, I can forgive Higgins his cliche's and his obsessive attention to his characters' drinking habits, because his characters are fun and interesting. He puts them in great plots and pulls the reader happily through them, and you can't wait to find the next book especially if it's got Sean Dillon.But not this one. All the characters are wooden. The action is colorless and completely unbelievable. A president guarded only by one secret service agent and a dog? A professional assassin who whacks his target on the head and then shoots someone else?There is no sense of timing or place, only the thinnest of motivations for most characters, and no justification for many of the decisions made by characters.This book is amateur hour. Don't bother. Read some of Higgins's earlier works instead."
1,"I would rather watch paint dry: Boy, this was a disappointing read. The characters were not well developed (hence challenging to keep track of), the plot was implausible yet predictable, and half way through I had to wrestle with whether or not to even finish the book. I did, although it was unrewarding to do so.I'd rate this lower if I could.FYI, if you're looking for an alternate selection in the same genre, I highly recommend Silent Joe by T. Jefferson Parker."
1,"Tired formula: Jack Higgins may not be running out of his fascination with modern weapons, fine dining, glamorous women or the IRA but he appears to be slipping on plot and character development. Sean Dillon makes Doc Savage and Dirk Pitt look like pikers. And this curious extension of gentlemanly methods for attempting to kill one another -- sending a crazed assassin and then both sides meeting later at the Savoy to exchange notes -- strains credulity.Higgins has done some first-rate work. Had this been published twenty-five years ago, this might have made a difference. It wasn't and it doesn't."
1,"This is not the Jack Higgins I know: This is by far his worst effort that I've read. He's not my favorite spy author,anyway. This book feels like it had been written to fulfill a publisher's contract or obligation that Mr. Higgins had assumed and needed to finish in a hurry. The characters are not at all fleshed out, and the story line is too contrived. I would advise not wasting time by reading this book."
1,"Completely predictable: Up to now, I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books, although they have tended to become more samey. I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger. The tired old characters of Dillon, Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable, highly contrived and unbelievable yarn. The plots have all been used before, and if you've read any two other Dillon books you'll be able to guess the next line throughout. I bought it to read on the plane - was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding. Give this one a miss."
1,"EXTREMELY SHALLOW: This book has no plot, and is so absolutely predictable that I had to put it away without finishing. Sean Dillon's character is getting so tired and his invincibility is sickening. A very poorly written book. The only good thing about this book is that I got it from the local libary and did not spend any money on it. Mr. Higgins, it's time to retire Sean Dillon and maybe spend more than 2 weeks on writing a book??"
1,"Cartoon Arab-Scottish Villain: I had the rare experience of giving up on a novel after only a couple of chapters when trying to read Edge of Danger recently, but Higgins managed to pen a book so lame that I refused to go any further. His bad guy is supposedly a Scottish-Arabian aristocrat but comes off as just another cartoon Arab terrorist with an implausible, pointless heritage. But, what do you expect from a middle-aged author who poses in bomber jacket and aviator glasses on the dust jacket.... depth?"
1,"Can't believe I read the whole thing: Given the lack of character development, or rather, simplistic and at times contradictory character development; the lack of any plot whatsoever; and poor visualizations; I can't believe I read the whole book. I guess I kept waiting for the action to start. It never did."
1,"I'd rate it 0 stars if I could have...: Very few books contain their own review. This one does:""Stone said, 'It really is like a bad movie, Harry.'""'You can bleeding well say that again. . . .'""This book reads like a 7th grade reading-level condensation of an outline of a screenplay: The paragraphs are no more than a few lines long; very few words greater than two syllables are used. No complex thoughts, no character development, no suspense, and little description. Pure formulaic twaddle."
1,"A bad book, poorly written.: The plot is not believable, there is not a shred of character development, and there isn't even any descriptive atmosphere. It shocks me that Jack Higgins and the publishers actually make money off of this puerile drivel. I shall not buy any more of his efforts."
1,"higgins disappoints: This is without a doubt Higgins' least inspired work in years. The plot is predictable and over worn, and the books is very uninspired. A real disappointment"
1,"Poorly Written: The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again."
1,"A Disappointment: It is hard to believe that the same author wrote The Eagle Has Landed and Edge of Danger. The writing is just plain shallow. the plot predictable. Save your money for something better."
1,"Horrible: This is my first Jack Higgins book and it will certainly be my last. Especially if, as the reviews state, it is the best Higgins book in a long time.The characters are never developed. The way the book begins, you think that the Rashid's are the good guys, and Dillin is the bad guy. Then all the sudden, without developing the characters, the roles are switched. You end up not caring who dies (and 6 billion people die in this book...a little overkill) and who lives.The ""adventures"" are similar to Dora the Explorer in how boring they are. They are very predictable, and of course, Dillin is killing 50 people and no one can kill him. Just ridiculous scenes.Don't get this book, despite the ""reliablity"" of the author."
1,"Not worth the effort: Edge of Danger is yet another installment of the on-going saga of Dillon, Ferguson and Bernstein. If you truly enjoyed the preceding efforts by Higgins, then you might like Edge of Danger (because it is more of the same). However, if you have been growing disenchanted by Higgins' efforts, then you probably want to take a pass on this (and for me at least, future efforts as well). Higgins' books are more and more like screen plays and less and less like novels. Dialog between the characters, which often is terse, choppy, and unimaginative, makes up virtually all of the text. Higgins almost completely avoids the opportunity add any depth and breadth to the story through the use of descriptive text. As with the last few books from Higgins, Edge of Danger is clearly a disappointment."
1,"Can't believe the publisher had nerve to issue this book: A terrible, childishly written book with absolutely NO redeeming value as literature. Higgins loves to ""speak Irish"" but even that gambit fails in this trite, poorly plotted, worthless endeavour by a writer who should remain retired if he can't do any better than such trashy writing."
1,"Disappointing and thin: I purchased this book expecting very good things. I found the plot very thin and predictable. There was very little suspense. It almost seemed like an abridged version of a book where all the detail leading up was left out. Also there didn't seem to be any character building or background to explain why these individuals would have such singleminded, and on the surface stupid, behaviour."
1,"Two Hacks: I don't know who is worse- Higgins or Macnee. The plot is so tranparent you can guess what is coming next. Completely implausible. Macnee's narration is so overdone it is laughable. Most of the time the characters do little more than quaff enormous amounts of Bushmills Irish Whisky. A real stinker. Wayne Schwartz, Los Angeles, CA"
1,"Just skip it: When you read a book you know that what are you reading is not 100% true, but when you start to read things that are completely wrong is another thing. For an example I have these questions:Q. How many times could a man pay another man to kill somebody, the killer fails and the boss gives him another chance?A. I don't know if the mob knows it but at least four times.Q. Why the target man, who knows who is trying to kill him and he saw him in a restaurant after he was in danger and just say hello to him?A. Because the target man likes to be in danger.Q. When the target man has the opportunity to kill the one whom wanted to kill him why doesn't he?A. Because something in his head didn't let him even if he had killed many men before.And as the energizer rabbit, I can keep going and going and going, my advise is to skip this book."
1,"Worst ""Live"" recording I've ever bought!: I bought this CD for one song only, ""Steal Away"". I knew it was going to be ""live"", but this isn't even close to the radio version. Try more like a ""muzik, lounge"" sound. It was recorded in a ballroom. Then, the only other song I recognized was ""Hot Rod Hearts"", again, done the Vegas lounge style. I wish I could get my $$ back. Why didn't he just put out the CD using the regular recordings? He was never a big star to begin with. I wrote this review just to warn people that it isn't like most ""live"" recordings. I was very dissapointed, and I still don't have a decent recording of ""Steal Away""!"
2,"A Different Collection of Early Stuff: This is among the first Ellington CDs I owned, and remains among my favorites. It presents a nice survey of earlier material, with many of his greatest hits as well as some less familiar tunes (i.e., ones you don't find on every collection of early Duke). Ivie Anderson's vocals really shine, especially on ""It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"". Not every song was destined for greatness, but the lyrics to ""Love is Like a Cigarette"" are a hoot! The sound is decent considering the age of the recordings."
2,"Great reference: The book was good. Kept my interest. In no way am I finished reading it. It isn't a book to read from front to back. The information on each herb is detailed. Great reference material. It was a good addition."
2,"Excellent Resource Book: I picked up this version of the herbal Magick books because I wanted to see what mr Beyerl had t offer to this vast and sometimes conflicting magickal practice.After reading through the book and using the index to find what I am nedding I must say where is ""The Master Book Of Herbalism?"" I want it..Mr Beyerl has done tons and tons of research on this material (check out the Bibliography) and it shows. His entries are precise with magical associations, common names, and other names.. It also includes suggestions for use.Not only that but, it takes the time to explaint he various ways to use herbs.This is a wonderfull addition to any occult library.."
1,"Has NO value!: If your studying herbs or medicinal plants this book should NOT be on your list of books to own. IT IS WORTHLESS! It is a Pagan Religion Book. Plain and simple! In my opinion it is for the study of WITCHCRAFT and the like."
2,"Really great 'baby book' for your 4-legged children: This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves their dogs as children. I bought one for our 3 year old adopted beagle, and am getting one for our daugher-in-law's birthday for their rottie. You can personalize it as you wish, and I have included comic clippings (Marmaduke, Mutts, etc.) that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever."
1,"needs $$ upgrade: Only has limited access to OBDII data stream unless you pay more money to upgrade the software."
1,"Only Windows XP and earlier Support: This scanner works great but if you want to update the unit or use their printing software you can only run their drivers on a Windows XP machine or earlier. Windows XP is over 10 years old. You can't load the data from the scanner into your computer if you have Vista, Windows 7 or Windows 8. They seem to have no plan to update their system for this scanner or any of the EZ Scan line.Keep in mind Microsoft is dropping support for Windows XP in spring of 2014, a little more than a year away. Why don't they have something that works with more current computers especially when you can only buy one with Windows 7 or mostly now with Windows 8.In addition, for most of their models the firmware is 4.07 and I believe the 07 stands for 2007 as that's as current as the unit shows for cars. If you have a car 2008 and later it doesn't show. Have to ask why they don't want to update the software for their products and still expect people to buy them."
1,"not very well written: This book was well reviewed and I was very disappointed. Even if it's written for poor readers, does it have to read like Dick and Jane? Children are young, not simple-minded. Give kids real literature or they won't keep reading, they'll plug in to the media."
2,"Hypatia: A classic story based on history. One of Hypatia's crimes appears to have been ready to provide a hypothesis of a heliocentric universe, long before Copernicus and with a much worse response from the Christian community."
1,"Scarlett Letter: Very disappointed! The book was missing several chapters. Because it was needed for school, we were forced to purchase another copy."
1,"Boring....Ridiculously long chapters.: The book I downloaded on my Nook and Kindle doesnt seem like the same one I read in school. This version Bored me to tears."
1,"scarlet letter: very hard to read, doesn't seem to go anywhere. I am struggling to finish it and may just give up."
1,"The Scarlett Letter: Written in old English. It was very hard to read as I had to think through most sentences to figure out what was being said."
1,"A thorn in the side of literature.: Hawthorne's use of symbolism throughout the book is undeniable, yet his obvious alcoholism takes over as the underlying factor present at all points. He relies on ambiguity far too often without the build up to a climax. The climax(es) happened before the book started and only happened to a select few who read this book. Read Atlas Shrugged, Anthem, or virtually anything by Aldous Huxley if you want some entertainment."
2,"A Moral Novel with a Mystery: I read this book during a high school vacation. Although the long words and unconventional characters did not catch my fancy, the mystery involved in the story captivated me. As the story developed, I realized the profound intricacy of the plot. The conclusion of the story was not happy, nor did it even seem fair. As one who knows Hawthorne's puritan morality standards, however, I say that he communicated his message extremely well."
2,"Excellent Book: I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone."
1,"technical problems with cassettes: This product requires a stereo player in which the balance is turned totally to the left. Most auto systems have that capability. However if you have Dolby or SurroundSound, it can be difficult (and maybe impossible) to play the cassette without hearing two recordings at the same time. Unfortunately neither the packaging nor the website will warn you of the problem. You therefore should think before buying. Once you have opened the packaging you may be unable to return the product."
1,"Mundane, Tedious, Just Plain Boring: With so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous ""A"" worn by Hester Prynne, I was very excited about reading Hawthorne's ""masterpiece."" Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I did find the symbolism that dealt with Pearl's fascination with her mother's ""A"" interesting, but the rest of the book I did not. Other than to be more literaraly savvy, I would not recomend the book."
1,"Oh god kill me now, this book is BAD.: This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS."
1,"Absolute Waste of Time: My 11th grade English teacher tortured me with this morbid book and I can't say if I'll ever forgive her. Not only was this this book boring but Hawthorne unnecesary uses all sorts of complex language to convey one simple thought. The only reason that I didn't give this book 1 star was because there was some art in the book and symbolism. WAY OVERRATED."
1,"A Tedious Read: I hate Hawthorne's style of writing. It's over-bloated and self-indulgent. I wish he'd just get to the point and stop blabbering on and on. The plot of the book seems like a modern melodramatic soap opera. All of the characters are one-dimensional. I'm not going to say the book is poorly written, but it's written in a style that makes the book kind of boring and tedious to read. Overall, a disappointment."
1,"Classic? Really?: I will never understand how ""Classics"" become Classics. So far for school i Have had to read far to many Classics. Dickens should be glad he is dead and does not have to read his books because they would probably kill him out of sheer boredom...Hawthorne creates an ok tale, but really? It gets dragged out and is suppose to be realistic. Then he throws Pearl in there, she is like some super-human and belongs in fantasy. I never really did believe in the whole 'they completely ostracized her but let her stitch everything.' That is just a bit hypocritical, either she was excepted as prat of the society *which she was not) or she wasn't (which she almost was. See that just doesn't make any sense. The story is suppose to show how unforgiving the society was, but it doesn't. It is better than Dickens, but then again everything is."
1,"This book was OK............: The Scarlet Letter, for me was just a little boring. Sometimes the description was just too long and I just started to lose interest in it. Also sometimes it got confusing as to what the relationships the characters had to each other. I would only reccomend this book to other people who liked reading lots of description, a little dialouge, and a repetitive storyline."
1,"I've read better.: I'm a 13 year old kid and I just finished reading this book for an English class I am taking. Although it was a very interesting and provkitive novel. I did not like it very much. I think it maybe that I'm still too young to throughly understand this piece of literature."
2,"Awakening.: This book is a masterpiece of not only American literature, but of world literature. Reading this book was the experience that showed me what good literature is. This is easily in my top three along with Fahrenheit 451 and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."
1,"The Scarlett Letter: Overall ok. Not much going on here. A lot of internal dialogue, nothing like the movie. I prefer the movie to the book."
2,"Great Condition, Almost Exactly What I Expected: I was quite pleased with the condition of this book, as well as it's hardcover, and the footnotes, definitions, and reading reviews for beginner readers of the genre. I am, of course, a huge fan of the Scarlet Letter itself and this copy served its purpose well. One of the few disappointments was that the color of the cover seems to look a little more coral, or pink, than scarlet or red. Also, the back cover is white, and I am most definitely one for appearances. I would have like a slightly more classic looking cover. Nonetheless, the binding will look fair on my bookshelf. Over all the book was clean and well taken care of, and was shipped to me with great haste; A Good Buy."
2,"Gripping: This novel is an Opera, pure and simple.Granted it is not the easiest novel to read, and Hawthorne can be slightly repetitive with the metaphors, similes and analogies that sometimes go on for several lines. Not to mention you could probably read half of each chapter and still keep up with the plot.Nonetheless, the themes are so strong it is no wonder The Scarlett Letter has been deemed a classic. The story tackles the issues of how one deals with his/her sins, and how honesty, for some, comes at the price of great shame.The novel does take patience, but it moves along at a very neat pace. Had the novel been written with more scenes, and less exposition, it could have been even more gripping.I read the Reader's Digest edition, which comes with about 12 lovely illustrations, which capture the essence and the mood of the novel. So that was nice eye candy.Look out for the last three chapters - talk about a fall-to-the floor, clutching-at-the-heart climax; it's all here! Breathtaking!Enjoy."
2,"Good read, but hard to navigate ebook: I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!"
2,"Why 5 stars? Because there's no 6th: A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint."
2,"love it: Book is a great read. Intriguing from start to finish. Cant find anything wrong to say. Would reccomend for beginer to advanced readers."
2,"remembered from High School (eons ago): I purchased a Kindle because I am having surgery on both hands, and this was one of the first items I downloaded. I have enjoyed reading it again and look forwaed to other free classics from the Kindle store - way to go Amazon!"
2,"A Classic: I loved this book in high school, and I love it now. A tale of a strong woman that doesn't let society bring her down."
1,"Typos: The most irritating part about reading this book is the typos. The book is already difficult to read with Hawthorne's prolix writing. I had to check with a different edition of The Scarlet Letter just to confirm whether or not it was a typo. Also, it would have been nice to have some footnotes like other editions do."
2,"Decent book, but definately not Hanry David Theraou: It was a good book to read given that is a classical in American literature but I much rather like Theraou's book Walden."
1,"Boring: I tred to enjoy this novel. In fact I battled through to about halfway hoping it would get better but it seemed to me a silly pretentious novel. The history of life in that era was mildly enjoyable but I applaud anyone who had enough tenacity to stay the whole journey."

2,"It's great.: This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)"
2,"The scarlet Letter: The book was wonderful and in good condition. I purchased it for my daughter, who is in highschool. The book arrived around the time it stated it would. Above all of that the price was great."
1,"Review From One Book At A Time: I hate giving classics bad reviews. This book was not for me. Nothing captured my attention and I found that I had to force myself to read it. If it had been any longer I would have stopped. It did catch my interest a little in the end, but not enough to redeem the book in any way."
2,"Amazingly Good: I came up to this book (a reading assignment for school) with a bit of dread, having heard that Hawthorne's writing could be hard to read. Actually, it was a delightful suprise to find it was a captivating plot, very well written, and very easy to read. I enjoyed it thoroughly. This book is about a woman who has an affair, choosing to bear the scarlet letter than reveal her lover's identity. Along side her is her ilegitamate daughter, a delightfully and hillariously strange character in the book. The scarlet letter is a good book having a melancholy but redeeming ending. A definate classic. Check it out... it'll be better than you expected."
2,"interesting book: though I'm not a native english speaker, I didn't find it difficult to read it. It clearly represents a period in american history which probably many would like to forget about. Sorry for high school students who couldn't understand it, something needs to be done in order to improve their reading comprehension and interest in their own culture.."
1,"Not my idea of a good read: I've read worse. But it takes a lot of mental energy to wade through all the commas and figure out the point of each paragraph. It seems a lot longer than 240 pages. I wouldn't have read it if I hadn't been forced to by the school. And the introductory thing is torture."
1,"Good book to read if you were bored to death!: I read this book over the summer because I had no time to go to a library or a bookstore and I had gotten to book for my birthday from my aunt back in May. I usually read ALL the time. If it's a good book, I can read it in less than 1 day. Sometimes it even takes me 1-2 hours. But this book took me 3 weeks. I couldn't believe how long it took me! Then it turns out that I have to read it this year in school. (UGH!) Please don't read this book, only if you love very old books that are very hard to understand."
2,"A well written book!!: The Scarlet Letter was an great book in that it kept me reading. It was not boring. It had sense to it. It has alot of symbols in it that makes sense and has a purpose instead of just being there."
1,"The Scarlett Letter is too verbose.: I had to read The Scarlett Letter for my honors english 3 class. I found that the author was too verbose in describing people, places, situations, and just the story in general. The book was so wordy, I often found myself forgetting the topic of that particular paragraph. Also, I was disturbed to find out that ever day the Reverand A. Dimmesdale would beat himself, and stay up till the early morning hours!"
1,"Bad Book: This is from a student's point of view. I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful. I can see how people might like it, the storyline is great, all the themes and everything, but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthorne's style. Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word, lets just say, it takes him AGES to get his point across."
1,"Duller than dirt: I teach high school English, and was required to teach thisto my students. I don't know who suffered more, me or them.To be fair, as one of America's first novels, it has interestingelements and Hawthorne does a good job.On the other hand, it is excruciating to read. There is nosuspense, little to sympathize or empathize with, and evenless to enjoy. A better writer could have told the samestory in half the number of pages. Some have labelledthis book a tragedy; they are right only in the sense thatit is tragically bad."
1,"I must say: that I don't like this book. I read it in high school, when all I did (and still do) was read everything I could get my hands on. I love literature, I am even majoring in creative writing in college. I UNDERSTOOD the book, what it was trying to say, the plot, etc. I just thought it didn't do a very good job of saying what it was trying to say. It was unnecessarily vague (what is the reason behind trying to confuse somebody?), wordy, high-flown and just too big. The story could have been told more effectively as a short story, even half the length. I don't reccommend."
1,"too hard to follow: the way the characters in this book speak makes it too dificult to follow along. i tried to follow along, but too boaring. also the book is mainly based on her thoughts. there is not a lot of human interaction with the main character."
1,"Historically accurate it may be, but a boring read.: I read this ""Classic"" novel for a class, and must admit I was thoroughly disappointed. Hawthorne should have stuck to writing non-fictional books about the Puritan settlers. This book was a pill. There are so many American authors, and novels that could be taught in schools that could far exceed the entertainment level of this out of date story. Two thumbs down."
2,"Wonderful classic: I enjoy this book very much. It is a timely classic with which I am happy to now have my own copy."
2,"Worth the effort: I have read this book twice now, once in high school and now again in my 50's. it is as pertinent now as it was when it was written. It was difficult read but the more I got into the book, the easier it became. The old English language is so extinct but beautiful and worth reviving. I plan to read it again in my 80's and I know I will see it in a completely different light. I recommend Cliff Notes to help navigate the language and themes."
2,"Puritanical ostracism: ""Easy A"" explains it best. If you can't relate in some way you must be a robot. Greatest book ever."
1,"Wasted Time: There is absolutely nothing captivating about this novel. Throughout the novel, only 3 major events occur: one in the beginning, one in the middle, and one at the end. The characters are flat and difficult to relate to. Overall the book was decent at best and could have been completed in no more than 50 pages or so. Hawthorne's writing is totally ridiculous. He goes on and on stating irrelevant details and fills page after page with unnecessary imagery. These pages consist of long paragraphs, some which encompass multiple pages. If I didn't have to read this for class I definitely would not have read it on my own. I'm not saying that it is a difficult novel, but it is an unpleasant one. In the end, if you are looking to read great American novels, skip over this one and go read some Steinbeck or Twain."
2,"Tragic: Beautifully descriptive, tragic story. Little pearl was the most captivating character in my opinion. Good read, would recommend to Jane Austen fans."
2,"Great: Great American classic that you can get for free on kindle. I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasn't not interested at the time. But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it."
2,"It's nice: it's nice. Very nice. Good indeed. I like it. Nathaniel Hawthorne. Exciting. Yes. Do you agree? Hester. Dimmesdale. Pearl. Chillingworth."
2,"Classic tale: Loved this book as well. The movies as always stray from the book- I was pleasantly surprised and taken in by all the characters."
2,"A Classic Worth Reading: My son had to read this for school and ended up really liking the story. It opened up dialog with us (his parents) about social situations, opinions and morality.I asked him about this review and he chose the review title and star rating."
1,"DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!!!: Please, I beg of you, if you have any respect for your own time whatsoever, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!!! Maybe if a couple of generations completey ignore it, it will cease to be a so-called classic. First of all, it is written in pretty difficult language. That is all fine and good if the book is worth the effort, but this one definitely is not. The author has no knowledge of subtlety and his message is both wrong, I believe, and poorly conveyed. The second star is given only because his use of language is sometimes impressive, but I would sooner read a taudry romance novel than re-read The Scarlet Letter."
2,"My favorite classic: Anybody who enjoys a book should read and keep The Scarlet Letter in their library. It's a classic, must-own for anybody that values the concept of reading. And if you didn't like it the first time, read it again and give it a second chance. I've read it about six times and it gets better each time. Cherish this book."
2,"Scarlet Letter review: Haven't finished the book, but love it. Little Pearl is my favorite character. The language is a little unfamiliar but very descriptive and eloquent. Recommend for anyone interested in religiosity of colonial times."
2,"Excellent romance in an excellent edition: Hawthorne's best work is central to understanding the trajectory of american culture from the Puritans to the moderns. Still, many of the book's allusions will be cryptic to contemporary readers. The footnotes and appendices make the book more available without all the weight of the Norton edition."
2,"The Scarlet Letter is a really good piece of Literature: I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it. I would definatly recommend this to other readers."
1,"Terrible book, do not read it.: Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz....."
1,"Meaningless Drivel: I stongly dislike this book. There is too much meaninglessness to it. I can read seven pages for something that can be stated in one paragraph...it's awful. Only Webster would be able to read this and not use a dictionary. I have understood two chapters! I don't see why an English teacher would like this book because it is full of empty sentences! It is hard for one to read this book without his mind wandering. As I stated before, this is not my kind of book!"
1,"Worst. Book. Ever.: It is my invariably correct opinion that the so-called author responsible for this overly extravagant and flamboyant style of writing should be dragged into the street and summarily executed, with EXTREME prejudice, for crimes against humanity and the English language."
1,"Who Chooses Classics?: I don't see how this book gets so much attention as being ""one of the best novels ever."" It's very short, and very boring. It's written in old english, which adds to the difficulty, and even if you can understand it, you finish the book and say, ""Ok, so what's the point?"" There is absolutely no point to this novel. Entire chapters of the novel are void of dialogue and appears as a wall of text, and the description is so vague that you can't even tell what a character is doing half the time."
1,"Don't pay for this on the Kindle: Unless you have the correct size font, you will have a difficult time reading this book on the Kindle. It is not set up to have the text wrap correctly and therefore has a full line of text, the next line has a single word, then another full line and so on."
2,"Strong Woman: 200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester. She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socety's rules. She is a role model for women who wish to be free. Sure, she made a mistake. But, don't we all? Adultery is not right, but we learn from mistakes.I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own. It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period."
1,"Slow, Overwritten Drama: It started with a great plot...until he actually wrote it. It was overwritten (it takes pages before something happens) and the protagonists were hard to like. Boring, sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose. There are a couple twists, but the main characters are such morons, it underscores the little action that does happen."
1,"Great Story ... Bad writing: So sue me ... I just don't like Nathanial Hawthorne. I think the plot is brilliant, but I find his method of telling the story annoying. I'm afraid this isn't an assertion I can back up with a lot of concrete examples, it's just that his writing gives me a vague feeling of malaise. I find this true of his short stories as well, so I never bothered with the other novels. But you'll have to read The Scarlet Letter for school anyway, so borrow it from the library."
2,"Wonderful, wonderful: Thank you, Erika Vause, for your positive review! I absolutely love this book! I had heard of this novel, but never considered reading it because the plot simply did not interest me. Then we read it in our academic English class (10th graders) and I was absolutely astonished!! Not only by the magnificence of the book--its themes of guilt and redemption are powerful and heart wrenching--but by the ignorance of some of my peers. It was obvious that their dislike sprung from the fact that they did not understand it! Please, please--read this book! You will not be sorry! I promise."
1,"Awful: I'll admit right up front that I am stupid. I would rather enjoy a book instead of try to find my way through the maze of confusing, endless prose that Hawthorne uses. I found myself empathizing more with Chillingworth than Dimmesdale. A book should NOT have to be dissected and disscussed to be understood!!! It should clearly portray its thematic structure without having to resort to a smokescreen of vague symbols and the word ""Classic"" stamped all over it to force people to appreciate it. Yes, it was heavily thematic and full of symbolism; and it was ""meaty"" (whatever that is), ""deep"", and ""powerful""; but it was dry, slow, and boring. Even someone as myself, who generally enjoys the classics, will fall asleep (as I did everytime I tried to read this book). Do NOT try to speed-read this. This book has no place in a high-school English course; it needs a span of several years to muddle and plod thru, and then try to unravle."
1,"So boring: I am an English teacher and getting through the book was tough. Only Nathaniel Hawthorne can make sex sound boring."
1,"The okay book: Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider."
1,"I HATE THIS BOOK: I'm sure I would be able to understand the vivid descriptions and symbolism in this book much better, if Hawthorne were not writing in some sort of moon man language. I don't know about the production of narcotics in the 1800's, but I honestly think that Hawthorne wasn't on a natural high if you know what I'm saying."
1,"Don't READ THIS BOOK!!: THIS BOOK SUX! Who cares about Pearl anyways! Someone shoot me in the head before i die of boredom!!!"
1,"If your looking to fall asleep than this is perfect 4 you !: Well, im 15 years old and my english teacher assigned this book for the class. I read only 6 of the chapters and then gave up . Maybe if it was somewhat interesting I would read it - but it has nothing to do with modern life.And to assign such a book at this time in a teens life is just pointless. Like I really care about what happenes to Hester. I've failed all the quizzes that my teacher gave us and most kids from the class did the same. Its one of those books where you read 4 pages and all of a sudden you realized that you were thinking about what you wearing today. Then i have to read the pages all over again. The book is extremely boring !! - I do not recommend it!"
1,"slowly falling asleep: The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it."
1,"one of the worst books I've ever read: typically, I will force myself to read even the worst books (for class, for ""fun"", because I think I should), but when I read this book for a [...] English course, I quickly realized it was one of the worst books ever (not to be taken lightly, seriously), certainly not worthy of a classic, boring, endless details that no one cares about... blah blah blah. Terrible. I was bored. It might have been too difficult for a 9th grader, but I wouldn't read it now either.on the other hand, my brother loved it."
1,"I only gave it a star because I had to.: This was the worst book I ever read. I was lost and confused and that was only in the first sentence. You would think that classic had to have some level of goodness, but this book was the worst piece of filth I had ever read in my entire life. It's no wonder that Hawthorn locked himself in his mothers attic, he was mentally ill before he ever wrote the book. If you are a high school student,like I am, you know the hell that I had to go through and I am guessing you never want to put yourself through it again. And to you who have no read this book, don't. You have not, or never will commit enough sin to be put in to the type of hell that this book offers the reader. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. Oh, and by the way who decided that this was a classic romantic book, there is nothing romantic about this novel, nor anything good. If you are in the mood for a good romance shoot for Nora Roberts or Sandra Brown, they can actually write!"
1,"paralyzing fear: The pain brought on by this archaicly verbose peice of literary kindling is so great that, while reading, I was greatly tempted to gouge out my eyes to prevent any future encounters with Mr. Hawthorne's ""work"". Please, for the love of all things sacred USE CLIFFNOTES!!! It will save you from years of therapy. I am scarred for live. My soul will be tormented after death and i will be forced to walk the earth in search for reconciliation."
1,"A sin to humanity: No, I'm not talking about Hester's crime. I'm talking about this STUPID BOOK! If only Hawthorne had kept his job in the customs house (see prologue), this abomination would never have been spawned from the cess-ridden depths of Hawthorne's twisted thinking organ. (You can figure THAT out on your own). This book is untolerably boring (the only proven cure of insomnia - if you don't mind the side effects) and the descriptions are ridiculously entangling. In the words of Mr. Hawthorne himself, this book is ""ignominiously"" dull. PRESERVE YOUR SANITY! NEVER READ THIS! NEVER!I sleep now..."
1,"forced to read the most horrible book ever: where to bloody begin.... ah.. in my junior year i and everyone else in class was forced to read the book and watch the horrible origanal slow and boring movie. after we got done with it almost everyone in the whole dang room yelled out that it suck, right at the same time. both this and the great gatsby sucked. but i dd surprisngly enjoyed the great gatsby movie towards the end of it"
1,"This book is a wast of good paper: Oh man, where do i begin with this one? First of all, I want to say that a 1 star rating is flattering this novel beyond all means. The Scarlett Letter is one of the most boring pieces of junk that I have ever been assigned to read. I realize that there is a ton of symbolism in this novel, but if you can't stay awake to find it, what's the point? Also, it really helps when Hawthorne decides to use 15 letter words in each and every sentence. Only person that I would recommend this novel to is an insomnia patient. This one ranks right up there with A Tale Of Two Cities (another ""Classic"")."
2,"scarlet letter: this novel is of course set in england in the eighteeth centuryher a young woman jailed for crimes she commted outside themarriage was branded with a scarlett letter over her bossom.this was tipical of the ear and time."
1,"Looooooooooooooooong.: If you can read and readily understand old-english, you *may* be able to enjoy this novel.I found it painfully long and didn't even care to finish it, which is unheard of for me!"
1,"Unable to Review: Unfortunately, I have to say that I am very very disappointed with this order. I ordered this book on Sept 2 for my daughter to read and write a report about for school. (Report is due Oct 25) and to date, October 9, I have NOT RECEIVED it yet. When I contacted the vendor to report last week, I basically received a ""sorry for your luck, but once it leaves our hands, we really don't care"" type of response. Totally not impressed."
1,"Painful: This was one of the most boring books i've ever read. Unfortunately i did not give up on Hawthorne after reading this novel, that was a mistake. I'd pass on this one if i were you, if you must read this for school I highly suggest getting a summary online."
1,"Incredibly confusing; have a dictionary on hand!: This is probably the most confusing and worst book I have ever read! The author uses incredibly large words and you constantly have to use a dictionary or else you most likely won't know hat you are reading. From my point of view as a high school (with mostly A's and good at English) student I would not recommend this book to any other high school age students. The author needs to get to the point and not drag on for pages about things that are not important at all. Long setences also makes the book drag on. If I didn't have to read this book for a book report I would have put it down after the first page or two and usually I finish every book that I start. This book had me in tears because it was so difficult. I had to ask my English teacher to explain this to me. Read this book at your own risk, but i do not reccommend it to anyone."
1,"Save Yourself: I agree 100% that Hawthorne was a brillaint writer. But this book was horrible. A simple phrase of action (Hester walking down the street) would be 4 pages of reflection. I read alot and am a huge fan of John Steinbeck, J.D Salinger, Mark Twian. I hated this book. It was took long and nearly impossible to read. If you have to read it for school, good luck. Otherwise, avoid this. There are much better classics than this."
1,"Ick.: Three words to describe my feelings of this book...I HATE IT.Hawthorne's writings are dull, dry, and other words that mean bad that start with D. The character's a boring."
2,"confusing, but good: Being in high school, it took a little bit to understand it, but after a while, I was able to get the basic point of the story. If you know you'll have to read this for school in the future, read it ahead of time. That way, you won't be reading on a deadline, which makes it worse. Read it at your own pace and you will understand it more. Also, the second time through, when you have to read it, you will see many things that you missed, and the story will be much more meaningful to you. (You'll do better on tests and quizzes, too.) Even if you're not required to read it, check it out-it's not called a classic for nothing!"
2,"SAD: this book represents a time in the past of our country in which we should be ashamed. not only was this a time of ""witchcraft"" and witchunts, but the society was willing to ostracize a human being for adultery. as if it weren't punishment enough for hester to have to wear the ""a"" on her chest, everyone stared at her peculiarly and did not accept her into normal society. i think this is overly harsh, yet this whole book reflects the time in which it took place very well. i would recommend it."
1,"The Next Best Thing to a Sleeping Pill!: This book literally put me to sleep. I could wake up at 2 in the morning and find the book in my lap, and then have to stress over finishing the assigned reading for my English class. I mean, some of the sentences are about 15 lines long, and the plot, if there is a plot, is incredibly slow. If the author would just tell it like it is, and not drag it out for pages, the book would be only about a third of the length that it is. Boring, boring, BORING!"
2,"great!: I've never heard of this author before so reading this was a bit of a gamble with me but I liked the sound of it. Well, I'm glad I took the risk. I was sucked into the characters lives and anxious to discover thier outcomes and fates. The plotline fell into place so well and wonderfully. Despite the fact that it wasn't full of suspense it was still SUCH a page turner. I loved the way the book was written, each line meant something and each line was meant to be there and each new page was like a new poem.It made me concentrate too. It's not the kind of book you can read half asleep before bed time, this book required my full attention."
2,"Beautifully Done: The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words."
1,"Not What it is Made Out to be...: It shocks me that the Scarlet Letter is the most taught book in the nation. It may have much symbolism and so on, but it is a convoluted mess. The author is completely detached from his audience, and for some bizarre reason, he feels he has to explain every little thing that happens in great detail. It is also irrelevant to our modern times. In our days people need to be reading things like Huxley, Orwell, Fitzgerald, Bradbury, Hemmingway, Steinbeck, Salinger, and many other great 20th century writers. This book is only relevant to those interested in the time period which it discusses."
1,"hate this new format: I didnt realize when I ordered it that the type was turned side ways. I bought this as a gift, but not sure I will give it.I guess someone might like the format, but I dont."
2,"Wonderful: Once you get past the language barrier, this book is an amazing read. To see the tragedies that some women went through at one point in history is a great thing, and to remind us never to let history repeat itself."
1,"Need a dictionary!: The Scarlet Letter is an interesting book. While reading the book I was filled with many feelings about it. I enjoyed some chapters, but loathed the ones describing the characters. I felt as if Hawthorne could have told the story more efficiently if he had described each character as they came onto the scene. The book made me feel inferior and uneducated. I made so many trips to get the dictionary that my legs got tired. I enjoyed the general story-line, but I could have left the adjectives behind. Pearl was my favorite character because she had a priceless intuition that helped me read the book. I would have been lost without Pearl's hints. I would not have read this book if not required to by my English teacher. Attack it if you dare!!"
2,"An Excellent Portait of Puritan New England: Nathaniel Hawthorne's ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a vivid (and accurate) portayal of life in Puritan New England. The prejudices, superstitions and institutions of the society are expressed so well that contemporary readers, who have little knowledge of New England's history, are able to feel the oppression and religious pressures that were common in that society. Indeed, this work is comparable (if not superior) to Arthur Miller's Crucible."
1,"Leave this one to the bibliophiles: Yes, I am a 17 yr old high school kid. But I can tell good books from the bad ones. ""The Scarlet Letter"" is a ""classical"" tale of 2 lovers. To be concise, this novel is too wordy to be enjoyable. People can say it's a classic romantic novel, it has good character developments, it has good themes and ironies, blah blah blah. I, like most people, don't judge a book by checking out its trap metaphors; all in all leave this book to a ""Doctor of Puritanical Philosophy"". If youre looking for a more entertaining classic, read ""Huck Finn"" by Twain."
1,"Yes, I was another victim who had to read this for school: Ok, when I first started this book I thought it was the dumbest thing and I could not belive this was a classic! (I still can't) After a few chapters I thought it was a little better and thats why I gave it two stars. Also, it is one of the better books that I had to read for school. I still feel that it was a little boring and hard to follow but with the class discussions I understood it a lot more. I still wouldn't reccommend this book to anyone"
2,"a book value: The classic book that is read by virtually every high school student in America ; and at a bargian price"
2,"Good read................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... .....: Good read................. ............... .... ....... ........ .......... ......... ......... ......... ......... ..... ..... ..... . . . . .. . . ."
1,"Not interesting at all: I was supposed to read this for English class,and had some interest because I`ve heard people and my teacher say that this was an American classic and was very good.But once I heard some of my friends who started to read it and say it was difficult and boring,I got the book on audio to assist me.I only got to chapter 3 and I was trying to guess how many pages were left to the end.Its uniteresting and difficult because the story wanders with absolutly no direction.I highly recomend getting Cliff Notes(which I got and are very easy to understand compared to the book) and possibly the movie(It might not be the same to the book, but having the visual aid of Demi Moore certainly helps the mind focus better)."
1,"This book is incredibly boring!: This is one of the all-time most boring books. I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down. I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book. I had much higher expectations for this book. If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book."
1,"Both forward and backward in its ideas: First of all: those who found the book to be dull, such as me, listen to it on tape (it's abbreviated yet still dangerous = boring to listen to while driving, as I found out). Indeed, Hawthorne introduces some advanced ideas for the times, such as writing about a single mother, as well as musings about women's rights. His obsession with Victorian themes, such as the deification of children, fixation on bodily sins, as well as overdramatization and simplification of the plot equals predictability and annoyance to the reader. While this book could probably be considered ""a classic,"" such as Tolstoy's ""Anna Karenina,"" both are better classified as carefully crafted literary exercises rather than engaging stories."
1,"I am going to bring Hawthorne back from the grave to hit him: Aghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, this the worst book i've ever read, I consider myself open to all fine lterature but I absolutely hate this book. But the writing is superb!"
1,"Not Worth Reading: Yes the writing is poetic...but the book says the same thing over and over. I didn't feel like I learned anything from reading this book, the characters are rather flat and the symbols are far too obvious and there is too many of them. It's like Hawrthorne had a contest with himself to see how many symbols he could cram in."
2,"Power to women: I read this book when I was 16 and I totally fell in love with it. I love the power it hands over to women. Hawthorne does a great job in illustrating the kind of prejudice society extends to women for actions that can be equally distributed to men but even more so he shows the determination of a woman to overcome whatever adversities may be present with renewed pride and dignity."
1,"it was very slow.: Hawthorne was a excellent writer for the 19th century, however, this book is very slow and often has no dialog for over a chapter. The descriptions get very long, boring and tedious. As you read this book your mind starts to wander and you can't remember what happened for chapters at a time. The only was I was able to get through it was by reading Cliffs Notes then the book."
1,"It wasn't good: I starting reading this book with great enthusiasm for my 11th grade English GT class's summer homework. I read and read, and I just started hearing names of people who, didn't make sense. I could never figure out who Reverend whatever is, or that other guy they talk about, I just went a long skimming the book, not able to feel any plot whatesoever! I was completely bored with this book. I didn't need a dictionary whatsoever either, but I will probably need Cliff Notes, so I could understand what the story is about, if anyone can help, please do."
1,"ugh: Why do books such as this keep being required reading in high schools? Havent there been any authors in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy? Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature lovers--and that's fantastic. But for most kids, give them something they'll enjoy reading and maybe they'll learn to love literature more. Books like this just antagonize and demoralize those who are not naturally literature lovers."
1,"A classic...but one of the worst books, ever.: At some point in your life you may have to read this snooze fest, and I pity the day you are required to read it. Hawthorne takes days to make a point, any statement at all, starting from the unbearable introduction ""The custom house"" through the last page. There is no action, no humor, no joy, only the character study of the puritan society, and a ""brave"" woman. Do yourself a favor and get the cliffnotes or use Antistudy.com. Anyone who truly believes this is a good is either a pseudo-intellectual, or they enjoy the same style of Melville, or anything written by Hawthorne. I would give this no stars if possible."
1,"How Can Sex and Sin Be So Boring?: Throughout this entire book, one part of my brain was in a state of wonder, trying to imagine how anyone could make a book about scandal, sin, adultery, public shame and cowardice so dull. To finish the book was a test of will, and was accomplished because I hate to leave things undone.There are many fine, engaging, interesting novels, both of our age and of Hawthorne's. I can't imagine why one would want to slog through this one."
1,"unfinishable: A classic? Hardly. In it's time this book may have ruffled feathers but these days it's a struggle to get through. Hawthorne's writing style is dreary and dreadful; if captivating readers was his aim, he failed miserably."
1,"American classic my ...: This completely predictable novel seems more like a beginner's attempt of writing a book rather than an American classic. The author treats the readers as if they completely lack a brain by stating the understood and by completely beating concepts to death (note the reference)."
2,"Hawthorne's Masterpiece: Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter is a tale of secret love, adultery, and sadness. Every person should read this timeless American novel at some point in their life. The strength of Hester Prynne is unusual for novels composed during the time this was published, and is therefore a revolutionary literary work. My only complaint is the length of ""The Custom House,"" however horrible this sounds, I would just skip it, it does not add to the plot of the novel anyway."
2,"Useful for AP Lit: I read Nathaniel Hawthorne's Scarlet Letter for my Advanced English 11 class. This is not a book I would normally have picked up and read, but I am glad that I read it.The Scarlet Letter deals with themes of love, society's oppression, secrets, a character finding herself, as well as numerous other classic literature themes. I found the book itself to be challenging to read, but I liked the story. Hawthorne explores when feelings and passion conflict with religion, which was fascinating to consider from a religious perspective.Although I did not enjoy the book much at the time I had to read it, it proved to be quite useful when I took the AP Literature and Composition Test this year. When I had to choose one book to frantically review the day before the test, this is the book I chose. Sure enough, this is the book I used for the AP test as a reference.This is an essential book for anyone taking AP Literature."
2,"Timeless Classic: I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter ""A"" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as ""Angel"" instead of ""Adulterer.""This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us."
2,"One of the Greatest Books Ever Written: The Scarlet Letter is an excellent book. Hawthorne spends so much time discussing the characters' thoughts and motives that by the end of the book, you can understand why the people act the way they do. It makes them seem almost real. He relates nature to what the character's are experiencing that makes the story even more powerful. In one place he told of a rose bush that grew by the prison so it seemed Nature was saying that even though other people had abandoned them, someone could always count on the nature's love. It's very beautifully written. The story of adultery and jealous spouses happens in our own day which makes The Scarlet Letter relate to the reader. It's just a great book all over, and I feel that it's one of the best ever written."
1,"Does not have true plumeria scent: I used to live in Hawaii. Plumerias were abundant, both growing and leis. I was excited to have that scent again in a lotion. The lotion itself is your average body lotion consistency. However, there is NO way that this is a true plumeria scent. I would not order their other ""Plumeria"" products (which are more expensive)based on this lotion."
2,"Just as described: This bench was easy to assemble, but I would suggest that you have someone else help you to hold the parts while you screw them together. Otherwise it might be too difficult, not in design, but just in holding the large pieces in the right place. I put the bench on my front patio which is uncovered. It doesn't usually snow in Seattle, but it did this year, and the bench remained uneffected. The bench has also with stood the Seattle rains. This bench is as stated, element proof! Great for summer yard lounging as well. I have been 100% satisfied!"
2,"The ultimate for women: My wife has several workout books but as she states, ""not one matches Arnold's"". This book not only covers subjects like what to eat, it also goes into great detail on what workouts work what muscles. Great book!"
1,"Boring: I love Arnold and what he has accomplished so it suprised me to suggest that women should start out using 3 lb weights. Sorry, you won't get results like that. This book my be good for seniors or those with limited physical ability."
2,"Dual Language- Selections from Don Quixote: I have found that this is an excellent tool for vocabulary building. I am able to understand the meaning immediatly and hope to continue buying dual language books for this reason."
2,"Best one in Tomato Trilogy: Return of the Killer Tomatoes is hilarious. Anthony Starke is great. J. Stephen ""Rock"" Peace is back as Lt. Wilbur Finletter. This is the best movie in the Killer Tomato Triolgy."
2,"Pretty Fricken Sweet: You know the movies, and if you're looking at this page, you probably love them. The bottom line is, you get 6 classic campy DVDs, in their own cases, for a good price. Some of these DVDs are hard to find on their own - I personally had been looking for Return to Horror High for quite some time, before I decided to get this set. It's well worth the money - you won't be disappointed."
2,"FT rules: Talk about a hokey plot and cheezy acting -- this movie is GREAT !! The 1980's will never be forgotten as a decade of some really sad movies. My God does George Clooney look young and with that mop of hair..... Can't wait to see The Killer Tomatoes take France."
2,"100 times better than the first: This is the best movie since Monsturds no wait this movie is better than Monsturds even. You will not find a much better than this film. The first film wasn't even close to as good as this 5 stars way up for an excellent come back!!!"
1,"Too Stupid: I bought this for my grandson who loves ""cheesy"" movies but even he said this movie was too stupid. The first Killer Tomatoes movie at least had some funny parts. This movie doesn't. Don't waste your money."
1,"DECEPTION!: Warning -- the two songs listed as ""Little Steve"" were written by him but are not the originals nor performed by him!"
1,"Warning: You are not downloading Little Steven: I tried to download ""Forever"" by Little Steven & the Disciples of Soul, and through a very deceptive listing accidentally downloaded this very substandard cover version. It's not the .99 cents that was stolen from me that I am worried about. It's a local bar band cheating people by listing the original artist as the performer when they know perfectly well they've never been in a studio with Little Steven."
2,"Warming Dishs Sooooo Helpful: The Sassy Baby warming dishes are great! Add the hot water let it sit while you get baby ready to eat and away you go. Also keeps the food warm while baby is eating. The bright colors also hold the babys attention. We bought two one for home and one for grandmas house.Sassy Baby Warming Dish, Colors May Vary"
1,"Not what we expected: The suction on this dish does not really work. The only thing I could get it to suction to was glass. we never really wanted it for the warming part, just for the suction. All in in all, we were not very satisfied with this purchase."
1,"Not user friendly: The dish is not easy to take apart for cleaning and I wish I could put in it the microwave."
1,"Not worth it: We tried this dish a couple of times. It didn't warm the foods that much more than just putting warm food on a plate & feeding it to your hungry baby. Just another (unnecessary) step in the feeding progress. Don't waste your time."
2,"Great warming dish: I love this dish. I try to keep from microwaving my baby's food, so I put really hot water in the base of this bowl. It warms my baby's food (even food from the fridge) and keeps it warm. As another reviewer said, the dish is very difficult to separate."
1,"NOT USER FREINDLY: This product is a good idea however:1. The fill hole, is not large enough to fill the bottom of the dishwith hot tap water without getting water into the serving tray.2. Can't be put in the Micro.3. Extremely hard to open bottom compartment to clean.4. Extremely hard to open and close ( I and my daughter have to use abutter knife to pry open).5. Not good for a grandmother's hands that has joint problems.6. Doesn't keep food warm for very long.Perhaps going back to the drawing board would help this product!"
1,"Disappointed: Maybe in time I will figure this plate out, but I cannot get the suction to work and there were no directions with it as to how to take it apart, use the suction, clean it out. It may seem simple, but a harried mother needs these details! I am disappointed as it is utterly useless to me, at least as far as being a stay-put dish, which is why I purchased it."
1,"Not User Friendly. NOTHING that says it's BPA-free: Nearly impossible to disassemble for cleaning.Hole for water is tiny.Bottom gets very hot to handle, food takes awhile to warm up, then remains warm for only about 20 minutes.MOST importantly, IS THIS DISH BPA-FREE OR NOT? I've seen it listed on BPA-free lists on the web, BUT, there is nothing on the package or product description that deems it so."
2,"Sassy Baby Warming Dish vs. Gerber Bowl: Keeps food warm. Sticks to the tray of the high chair. Gerber bowl doesn't stick. The little dividers are nice for serving. The only complaint is that it is very difficult to get the divided bowl off the bottom."
2,"just what i was looking for: i do not use these for warming the food. i did try that once and it was just a pain. i purchased the bowls because they are divided and stick to the high chair. so they are great for that, but i would not recommend getting it if you are just looking for a warming dish."
2,"Must-Have for Children's Library: I ordered this book as part of a third grade curriculum for my son. These Everyman titles are really wonderful-- beautiful binding, heavy pages, amazing illustrations. I was not disappointed with this book. It is the kind of book we will read again and again and hopefully pass on to the next generation. Hawthorne's rendition of the myths and fables is classic and engaging, and Rackham's illustrations are worth the price on their own."
2,"Very informative: I just returned from a month-long trip to Vietnam and Cambodia, and I found this book extremely useful for Cambodia. Not so much for hotel listings, etc., but for no-nonsense background information on Angkor, Phnomh Penh, and Siem Reap. The Vietnam portion was helpful as well, but I relied more on the Lonely Planet and Rough Guide Vietnam editions for that country. I would definitely recommend this book to someone traveling to Cambodia over the Lonely Planet edition, which is *really* outdated."
1,"...: I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999. The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died. Cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...Too much has changed for this book to be of any use"
1,"1996 edition of book is outdated: The book WAS good in its time but EVERYTHING related to traveling in this area of SE Asia, especially Laos, has changed drastically in the past three years. Frankly, a 1996 edition should be sold as remainders at about $2, then someone who wanted only info about the people or the temples could get ethnographic info only! I was in Laos this past August 1998 and most published info, except the Internet updates by an Australian in Nong Khai,Thailand, who does visas to Laos, was wrong and very outdated--especially the most important things like availability of visas and safety of bus/road travel. Real traveling info from books like this that are so old could be very misleading!"
1,"Disappointing: This book is getting mixed reviews. It seems like friends of the author say its great. Those who tried to actually use the book are disappointed that everything is so out of date. This edition was not updated since the first edition and is now really out of date. Things change, but sloppy research is always out of style."
1,"Arrived broken!: Well, this is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" kind of reviews. Didn't pay much, didn't expect much, but basically functional would've been nice. The generator came broken (probably a miswire internally). Yep, I checked the outs with a meter... and if I finagled the probe inside and touched the right spot, I got voltage. Just not externally. Too much trouble to return it and convinced my 10-year old to go with a real light powered by batteries."
1,"complicated: I still haven't figured out how to put this light together. When I do, the wires appear very delicate and I doubt it will even work. The directions are atrocious. But at least it doesn't require batteries, so you can feel good about not destroying the environment too much."
1,"junk: this thing is nothing but s piece of junk it came broke,didnt,work i wouldnt of rated it but i had to:[DO NOT BUY THIS ITEAM-it is nothing but a piece of junk"
2,"entertaining, but not for everybody: Although, in a certain sense I did not like this movie - one thing that I did find that I did like was that it was entertaining. It's a daring movie that take a rare look at what we've been missing in today's corperate -hectic (kiss butt) culture. And that is emotional honesty. It's like a release, a drug, or even bad music that we enjoy because it allows us to express ourselves for who we know what we are to be what we are, and not necessarily how we act in everyday life. We definately need more movies like this (despite what some critics may say)."
1,"Adam Sandler lame as ever...: I was told that this was a decent movie.But I didn't care for it. I find Adam Sandler as funny as Jerry Lewis, not very...The animation was pretty good however."
1,"One of the worst I have ever seen: Do not buy or rent this. Adam Sandler is officially a no talent hack. This is not for children or anyone for that matter unless lame brained scattological humor with absolutely no point is your thing."
1,"Nauseating!: If you are adamant to watch this movie despite all the negative reviews, please do it after the Holliday season. This is the most depressing, sad, pathetic, sarcastic and cruel movie that I've ever seen in my life.Through all the movie I felt that I am going to cry and was depressed for the rest of the day. Basically it is a movie about a guy that lost his parents during his childhood, twins with serious genetic disorders and a single mom. How somebody could find it funny is beyond me.If you want to kill the Holiday spirit and get into a deep depression than this movie is perfect for you! If not - skip it."
1,"Spare yourself.: This movie is such a bizarre combination of morality and immorality it seems like no one would really like it, but there are always exceptions.If you're looking for a sweet Christmas tale, watch A Christmas Carol or The Grinch. If you're looking for potty humor, watch Beavis and Butthead. This movie tries to be both, and in the end, the sick humor and complete meanness just cancel out the moral message the plot tries to portray, leaving the viewer with nothing. Anyone who has the impression from these reviews that this is a ""moral"" movie, please beware, it is far, far, from it. There were glimmers of morality and good humor in there, but they were all but eclipsed by the nastiness."
1,"Adam Sandler's eight crazy nights: I thought this was a big dissapointment! It is crude beyond ""good taste."" I wish I could return the DVD but I don't have my receipt so I'll just ""trash it!"""
1,"A very disappointing movie: Its sad that a animation that is clearly made to attract children was made with such rude humor and disrespect towards others. How this animation could be recomended for anyone is beyond me. Shame on you Adam Sandler that your ability is not used for more postive purposes."
1,"8 Crazy Nights: DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! One reviewer states, ""the funniest Christmas movie ever"". This could not be farther from the truth. I like many of A. Sandler's movies. However, this movie sucked really bad. It was crude and not funny (reindeer pooping and eating poop?...come on!). It was irritating and not funny (the old man's voice was so grating, it made you want to scream five minutes into the movie). Most of all, the movie was boring and embarrassing to watch in mixed company. I still can't believe I wasted $4.00 to rent it."
1,"Clean it up!: The Story is appropriate and some parts are really funny but some of it is horrible (sickest humor he's done in any of his movies that I've seen). Definately not for kids. I expected better after Mr. Deeds. Adam Sandler is really talented and there is no reason he has to produce such trash. I love the Chanukah Song! I'm not a Jew but it makes me want to celebrate Chanukah.There are only two real redeeming features of the movie. These are the little old man Whitey, because he loves everyone in his actions even though they treat him like ..., and Stone's repentence (for lack of a better word) at the end."
1,"1 star, since there's no ""zero stars"" available: I can't believe the reviewer who turned this off after the first 30 minutes. How in the world did anyone watch this for 30 minutes? So I only watched 10 minutes, but a movie that starts the way this one does is not getting any more of my time. My hairdresser highly recommended this, and all I have to say to her is, don't give up your day job to become a movie critic! Total garbage."
1,"Eight Crazy Nights: I couldn't tell you how this movie ends, we turned it off after the first half-hour. Not appropriate for children, not entertaing for adults. Our dog even left the room. Don't waste your money."
1,"Parents - Don't Let Your Kids Watch This Movie: Someone I know bought this in a discount rack, thinking it was what it pretends to be -- a children's holiday cartoon. Nothing could be further from the truth. I could not believe what a disgusting piece of filth it is, full of perverted sexual innuendo. Movies like this should not be marketed toward children, and no matter what the rating, that is who they were trying to target by making it look like a children's holiday cartoon. It should be kept in the back room of video stores with the restriction that only adults could see it (and then only if they have absolutely no taste nor moral fortitude whatsoever). I can't give this as strongly negative a review as it deserves! I only gave it one star because they wouldn't let me give it none."
2,"sandler is da bomb: 8 crazy nights was a movie that was touching and hilarious. Adam Sandler was good and should be seen by families."
1,"The thrid in a string of flops for Sandler: Eight Crazy Nights is the thrid back to back unfunny movie(following Little Nicky and Mr Deeds) that Adam Sandler has made in the past two years. Eight Crazy Nights is full of toiler humor and unfunny one-liners. I may have laughed once or twice if these movie. They should have called Eight Crazy Ways to ruin a comic's carrer."
1,"i want my money back: Most likely one of the worst movies i have ever seen! I went to see this movie with about 5 or 6 friends, when it was over, we all wanted our money back! The movie is not funny at all. Believe me i love adam sandler but this isnt even a comedy, there are alot of sad parts in it, but they label it as a comedy. All this movie actually is happens to be is a fairy tale for little kids, huge waste of money. If you want to see a real adam sandler comedy wait for anger management or rent happy gilmore."
1,"terrible movie: I used to be a fan of The Simpsons, but now much more of a South Park kinda guy, so it's near impossible to offend me really.. The humor was good in some spots, but overall I fould it to be annoying and pointless. The emotion and general plot was pretty good, and I've always liked Sandler for his singing abilities and SNL work, but this movie was bad (some of the singing was okay, but personally I didn't like half of it). Most of the content is incredibly gross and could make you vomit if eating, but that's Sandler's great gold."
1,"Not a Good Hanukkah or Christams Movie!: This movie was terrible!""WARNING SPOLIERS MAY BE POSSIBLE!""Well it starts out with Davey, a drunk who is crude and mean. Then when he gets into trouble he's doomed to community service with the town migiet Whitney, (No offence to little people out there, that it not my intention to offend anyone). Whitney sounds like Woody Allen on crack, and his fernal twin sister Elenaor isn't any better.Well Davey does all he can to offend Whitney. That is until his place burns up! So he moves in with Whitney and his sister, and they set some ground rules. Then as the movie goes on, they make a big deal about Davey having little emotion, and when he cries it's all the sudden a big deal! And for some reason the deer in the woods talk, and help Whitney out. What or who is Whitney supposted to be Santa Claus?I hate the music in it, the voices are annoying, and the characters are mostly unlikable! So warning to parents, keep your children locked up from this totally bad movie!"
1,"The worst movie ever made: Yeah, it sounds like a cheery holiday movie for the kids, but it isn't.It's mean-spirited movie that goes nowhere. It's crude and rude as you would expect from Sandler, but not even in a funny way. Imagine Sandler pushing a little old man in a port-a-potty down a hill so that he becomes a frozen sh*tsicle...then imagine reindeer coming to lick it off him and getting sh*t stuck in their teeth. Yup, that was in there and was about the extent of the humor therein.Please don't buy this. And if you do, BE SURE to watch this before giving it as a gift or letting your children watch it."
1,"ive seen this before...........: this is the worst comedy evericould tell this was an adam sandler movie right from the startit its a compilation of all the weak jokes from his past movies and albums, actors and songs put together to make a very dissapointing comedy. Had i known this movie was so bad, i hoped someone would have brought it TO MY ATTENTION YESTERDAY!!!!"
1,"ugh: The packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted. I wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesn't even look new!"
2,"Awesome: I have been a huge Adam Sandler fan for years. I love this movie it makes me laugh so hard. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the same old same old holiday movies. Two thumbs up:))"
2,"Hilarious: I loved this movie. It was hilarious and Sandler's fans especially will be cracking themselves up. I must admit that it is very crude at parts, so although the cover looks appealing for youngsters, it probably isn't suitable for the young ones. Although, I must admit that a lot of the jokes will go right over their heads.The message is good and the overall story has a message. I cried for Whitey, and I think any movie that moves a person to the point of crying is worth a watch. But it is HILARIOUS, from the triple breasted lady, to Whitey and his sister, to the deer (who's significance I really didn't understand).A must see for anyone <over 13> with a good (but stupid) sense of humour and a desire for a couple of laughs!"
2,"Adam Sandler is Awesome: This movie is great, but having it on 2 disc special edition maked it even better. The special features are the shiznit."
2,"Crazy about 8 Crazy Nights!: This movie is awesome. It is the perfect movie for the holiday season. I am absolutely crazy about Whitey, the old man referee in the movie. Elenore and Davey are also hilarious! I love this movie and watch it over and over again with my whole family. Something you should buy because it is great!""Smell you later poopsicles!"" (A funny line from the best movie in the WORLD!!!)"
1,"Childrens Humor Not Suitable For Children.: I want to say first that I am an Adam Sandler fan. I loved him on SNL, I have enjoyed him in everything from ""Billy Madison"" to ""Punch-Drunk Love"". So with that in mind, I had high hopes for ""Eight Crazy Nights"". To say it was a let down would be an understatement. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in recent memory.The only thing remotely close funny is the old man named Whitey. He has a few lines that might warrant a slight chuckle. Sandler's Davey Stone character is so annoying, you will probably be tempted to turn off the movie within the first 10 minutes. If you don't, you'll be treated to jokes about hairy butts, a woman with three breasts, a man eating a jock strap and deer licking frozen feces. Sounds appealing, doesn't it?I am sure some diehard Sandler fans think this is funny, but I don't. Hopefully his first animated movie will be his last."
1,"Nightmare Before Hannukah: I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this ""feature"" to anyone. ""Eight Crazy Nights"" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch ""Ishtar,"" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest."
1,"Okay. There is a movie worse than Stargate.: Let me start out by saying that I enjoy Adam Sandler movies. I like Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore. Sure, they're not great films, but they've given me plenty of laughs. So when I tell you that this is one of the most dreadful movies I've ever watched, you'll know it isn't because of some bias against Mr. Sandler.This may be the worst movie ever made. It is cloying, stupid, unfunny, weird, and pathetic--in a bad way. I could go on about the awful story, the grating voices, the cliches and schmaltz, or the bad songs. (Yes, Virginia, this is a musical. The worst musical ever unleashed on film. No, I haven't seen every musical; but you don't need to in order to fully understand the depths to which this film sinks.)Don't see it. Don't buy it. Don't rent it. Don't send any signal that they should make more cr*p like this."
1,"Worse Movie I've Seen In Ages: I gave this 1 star because they wouldn't let me have 0 stars. The movie is just plain horrible. The 12 year olds in the audience enjoyed the juvenile, flatulence and other bodily function humor. But, this was the same audience that was passing gas in the theater and laughing at themselves. It will be a long time before I waste money on another Adam Sandler film."
1,"To be honest....: To be 100% honest i thought the movie was boring and too sappy for a cartoon.The old guy got on my nerves and the movie was just so unlike adam.I mean come on we all know he could have done way better than this stupid movie.Im sorry but i just think the movie was horrible."
1,"Sucks: Yeah well this movie was just terrible. Sandler tries paroding the classic cartoon musical but he fails in every way possible. I mean this is a stupid movie, one song is about how great the mall is and then another song has the logos of different stores singing to him. It's almost a marketing ploy to get people to go holiday shopping more. The film also tries to make the audience sympathize with Sandler's character but once again it fails, we have seen the Grinch and A Christmas Carol too many times to actually care about this Jewish Scrooge. This movie sucks all around with cheap gross out humor that may have worked better had it been live action but that would have defeated the purpose of the film. And one last comment, Why the hell is this a double disc DVD? All of Sandlers good and/or funny movies are singular yet this movie is terribe and it gets the extra feature treatment. This movie sucks."
2,"return to forever proto-type: Three musicians out of five on this effort formed Return to Forever, so you can imagine a strong resemblance to the ECM first album. I always loved Corea with Farrell, because of the pulsing sound Chick adds behind Joe's flutes, sax, etc., like rain drops or storming. Nice soprano. And ELVIN JONES! I put this up up around the ""Joe Farrell Quartet"" album, and Buster William's bass is great, so much I don't miss Mclaughlin or Dave Holland. A fresh sound, unparreled even now. It makes me want to see the Outback movie. The album cover is beautiful. Finally, the price is outstanding. Before Joe tried funky disco sounds and lost his way."
1,"Inappropriate for young children: In two of the episodes, the word ""shut up"" is used. My son is three years old and instantly picked up on it, repeated it, and told me it was a bad word, but that James and Duck (the trains) had said it. I would stay away from this one, especially if you have young, impressionable youngsters. I gave it one star, since the wooden dragon train came with it."

2,"yo ho ho: arrr matey yer not gonna sail the seven seas without this are ye? this flag will stand up to yer most extreme swashbuckling"
1,"Illegible: It was an illegible **photocopy**. It appeared as if someone took a picture of every page of an original ""Principles of Science"", then faxed those pictures to the printer in order to produce this book.I returned it immediately."
2,"The only boots my husband will wear: These boots are very well made. my husband wears them for work and he loves them. They hold up well even with every day wear, got a year+ out of the last pair. he also says they are very comfortable."
1,"Why so expensive??!: Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy."
1,"Spun Out: The best things about this heavily formula vehicle are (1) Elvis' opening production numbers (including a nicely staged ""Adam And Evil""); (2) Deborah Walley's ""girl drummer"" role; (3) the Deusenberg; and (4) Elvis' closing production number, the medium walking blues ""I'll Be Back"". Everything else is redundant."
1,"The Road To Love Is Full Of Danger Signs...: Three lovely young ladies all want Elvis' gearstick in this craptastic musical comedy that's so bad it ROCKS! I just love the title song sequence where Les and the guys 'provide' Elvis with ""...lots and lots of girls."" And who was that chick, the blonde with the short cropped hair who literally shoves all the other chikadees aside to get up and spinout with the King? She looks like she's out to prove she can really score, and I never saw parts move like that before! Elvis looks embarrassed. Anyway, after you've crossed those double lines and Spinout you will want to do so again and again and again. Simply awful, but I mean that in a great way."
2,"Who else would have three beautiful women after him?: ""Spinout"" has Elvis playing a singing race car driver with three beautiful women who want to race him down the aisle to marriage. They are Shelley Fabares, Diane McBain, and Deborah Walley. Looks like Elvis has a tough decision. I can't decide myself. In ""Spinout"" you'll find two veteran stars in the height of their stardom: Cecil Kellaway and Una Merkel in one of her last roles. Also, the man who plays Shelley Fabares' father is Carl Betz who also starred with her as her father on ""The Donna Reed Show"". So, try to not to knock this movie. It's got great songs and the title tune was a top 40 hit by just that much. So, treat yourself to a swinging film that you just can't understand why Elvis wants to stay single."
1,"Presley's Worst Film: ""Spinout"" (1966) represents the nadir of Elvis Cinema - a bad sitcom without the laugh track. The only redeeming features are a few memorable songs, such as ""I'll Be Back"" and ""Stop, Look and Listen."" Buy the soundtrack and skip the movie."
1,"The music's better than the movie: SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" and ""I'll Be Back"".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first."
1,"NOT A GOOD SPIN FOR PRESLEY: This is not Presley's best vehicle but by this outing he was not being allowed to act anyway so he appears to be just going though the motions. The movie songs are not a real treat either, he seems to be singing to everyone including his enemies. (Where does the music come from when he sings anyway). When asked to do this movie Presley should have ""JUST SAID NO""!!!"
2,"Spinout: My husband and I love auto racing of all kinds. My husband loved this movie. I'm writing this review for him, as I'm not much of an Elvis Presley fan."
1,"Piece of junk!: This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort."
2,"Works and is easy to use: You drop a fixed number of drops into a fixed amount of water, as measured in the enclosed test tube up to the given line. The number of drops to use is listed right on the bottle. After a few minutes, you compare the color of the water to the color chart on a card, which gives you your nitrite level. It's plenty easy and effective.It could be even easier if the chart was on the bottle (no need for that extra card lying around), or if there was a test where you just stuck a gauge in some water and got the value, but I've never seen anything like that that doesn't expire at some point."
2,"Great Buy!: This item arrived well packed and undamaged. It looks exactly like the picture, was fairly easy to assemble and is sturdy and well made. Of course, it is an ""assembly required"" piece of furniture, but once put together, it looks like a really nice quality piece. My daughter loves it. It is sized for a child, and is too small for an adult. I think she'll be able to use it through age 11 or 12. It also has a convenient hole in the back of the hutch for her computer wire to poke through. I looked at this item EVERYWHERE including eBay, and Amazon was the cheapest of all. The chair comes included, so don't buy an extra chair separately!"
2,"Great Desk!: This is the best kids' desk you will find for the money. I can almost guarantee that! It comes well packaged and requires very little assembly. The wood is solid, not the cheap particle board you find in most big box stores."
2,"good quality for price: This desk is really pretty. It is a good size, but not overly big in the room. I learned from other reviews that the chair is included with this desk purchase, and not to order the chair separately. I also ordered the matching 3-shelf bookcase, which is a slightly different shade of white, but nothing too noticeable--especially since they aren't by each other. We rubbed beeswax on the bottom of the drawer so it slides more easily. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but still wants something that looks nice."
2,"Great desk and a great buy! Thanks Amazon:): We bought this desk for my seven year old daughter to keep her lap top on and to do homework. It was not to disappoint. The desk is perfect size for her to sit and work. Very high quality and easy to put together. I would highly recommend this product to others?"
2,"Love KidKraft: I love this desk! In fact, I have two! One for my daughter and one for my son. They are beautiful, flawless and go together easily. They are sturdy and should last a many years. So happy with this purchase!"
2,"Great Value for Less Money: I searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my son's small room -- I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch (as a large hutch wouldn't work)...and at a reasonable price. The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be ""normal"" desk height for later years, making is a ""Teen""kraft desk ;-). Thanks."
2,"very nice: This desk is definitely worth the money. My daughter wanted a white desk with a hutch and had picked out many over [...] not including the chair. I ordered this one without her knowing and at first she was upset because the hutch is not that big. But once it was assembled she loves it. She is 8 and loves the little cubbies in the hutch. Everything is packaged nicely and there was not one scratch or ding or funny smells. The hardware had everything you needed (no extras) in separate baggies for the chair and desk. I put it together myself in about 1 hour. We did replace the knob with a blue glass knob from the hardware store just to make it a little more unique I guess and it looks great. With free supersaver shipping and no sales tax, there is no better buy out there. Trust me, I have looked!"
2,"Very Satisfied: I was very pleased with this desk and chair- Was able to assemble it fairly easy and now my daughter is enjoying it very much- The desk is quite sturdy and the chair is strong- The delivery of my product was expedited quickly- Thank you very much"
2,"Great value for good quality product: Love this desk and chair set. Bought it for my KG'er who is enjoying using it for his arts and crafts projects as well as for homework. It is good quality, took less than an hour to put together and definitely sturdy material - this coming from a mom of a very rambunctious 5yr old. The only thing is that I can see my kid growing out of it in 2 or 3 yrs. It's not very high and the chair is small, so is more catered to younger kids, i would say probably 8yrs and younger."
2,"If it's good enough for Popeye...: I always keeps a can of this fine product on me person. You never knows when some palooka wot ain't on the up and square is gonna need to be put in his place. It always leaves ya strong to the finish."
2,"A Must Have for ALL Aspects of Love Devotees!: Being a huge Aspects of Love fan, I was extremely excited to find another cast recording. I was sceptical however, after reading reviews for this recording. After listening to it, all of my fears were put aside. This is a wonderful recording that possesses both brisk conducting and deep emotion from its musical director. I felt that the cast was extremely dramatic and that the piece was very well sung. Having listened to several other ALW cast recordings I feel that this cast was excellent. A must have for all Aspects of Love devotees!"
1,"Cheap and dangerous: Though I've had this only about a month, it is starting to go. It puts shards of sharp plastic in the food. (From searching the net on this, I find that my experience is not unique, either.)Do NOT buy.Other better brands include Unicorn (recommended by a famous cooking magazine), Peugeot, Firth, and William Bounds."
1,"Skip it - buy the full sized version: This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything."
1,"Slow: I bought this grinder because it could be operated with one hand. However I was very disappointed in the volume of pepper it puts out per squeeze. If you are looking for a good wrist strength training exerciser this is your grinder."
1,"Multilevel marketing meets education: I had to purchase this book for a community college class I'm taking. As a ""textbook,"" it has been a complete disappointment. The ""science"" is sketchy, the research is shoddy, and the huge holes in logic are brushed over with explanations like ""you can't prove nearly anything empirically in education"" (straight from page 8!). Some of the concepts presented are interesting, but since Mr. Jensen (no, he doesn't hold a doctorate) provides almost no citations for his claims, there is no way to check his assertions or determine where the theories come from. The book reads like a multilevel marketing sales pitch. In fact, you are encouraged to share it with your friends and colleagues and are directed to a website where you could empty your bank account getting ""certified"" in Mr. Jensen's unique, ""empirically unproven"" techniques."
2,"Well-Researched, easy to read, practical: Mr. Jensen has saved me and other teachers the time of gathering together the latest information about the brain, learning and so much more! He has made all this scholarly research accessible and fun to read. I wish the deadwood at my school would at least read this book but I hope they would also use the great ideas in it, too, for the students' sake!"
1,"BROKE IN A MILLION PIECES: I was not able to see if this piece was nice or not. It broke into a million pieces on arrival. You could hear the delivery guy when he was walking to my door. VERY DISAPPOINTED because it was a gift. Returned it right away! Buyer beware!!"
1,"Not packed well at all - arrived completely shattered!: I was very excited to receive this - but when it was delivered - it was a cake dome in a box - shattered into pieces because it was not wrapped inside the box at all! And I ordered it new! Would not purchase again - will go to the store to buy any sort of glass product."
2,"Great, but found it cheaper!: This is a great cake dome -- it's beautiful and the price isn't bad! But I actually found it a few days after I used it the first time at Target for $15. I couldn't believe Target was cheaper than Amazon -- that rarely happens! So check there first. Still, I think it was worth way more than that, so if you don't find it there, definitely order here on Amazon!"
2,"good value: Packaged well and received in excellent condition. Looks as pictured, heavy weight glass, substantial size and attractive design. Very reasonable price as compared with many others. Very happy with purchase."
2,"Perfect gift for the family: Purchased iwth Amazon Prime, it got delivered in two days without any damage. Shape and size are perfect for my sister who is getting this for Xmas and to use during her house parties."
1,"False advertising: Received the correct box, which was damaged as noted in item description, however, the cake dome was not the item pictured and not the item in the product description. It was a very used dome from a different manufacturer and very different style (black and handpainted). Diasppointed as the savings for this particular item was significant when compared to a new one when I took the sellers word as in the product description aned photos."
1,"Beautiful but Misrepresented: The Cake dome set was beautiful. I needed a 14 inch diameter plate because I was making a 12 inch cake. The lid had an 11 inch diameter so would not fit the cake. I was disappointed because when I search Amazon for the 14 inch cake plate; there were many unrelated products choices. It was very frustrating. Amazon, please only give unasked for alternatives. I know I am going to google search my product choices to find websites that only give me what I want!"
2,"Nicest possible domed cake stand!: I was teased rather mercilessly after I first purchased this domed stand, but it quickly one of our favorite kitchen storage pieces! In addition to its old-fashioned beauty, it is a wonderful storage and serving piece for cakes, pies, and tarts. The dome is very solid to protect desserts but also fits nicely (and heavily) onto the base, keeping things fresh at room temperature. Highly recommended!"
2,"Unnecessarily Dense but Useful: Dramatica: A New Theory of Story is a useful prep for using the software. It's an interesting and complete theory of story too, which is great. The book in general is well worth reading. My only problem is that if it's worth saying, it's worth saying WELL and this book uses twice the number of words it needs. The density of words also confuses the message. I felt, on more than one occasion, that the author was willfully complicating the message in order to ensure more sales of the software.Again, worth reading... valid and useful ideas... enough extra words that it undermines its own usefulness."
2,"You can get as a podcast: This is a good resourse, but if you are thinking about buying this book, do realize that you can download the lecture free as a podcast on iTunes."
2,"important for my research at college: This book is very important for american descendants living in Brazil. We can't let the culture dies."
1,"Piece of junk: I bought this for my 8 year old son who is extremely interested in exploring the things around him. The Scope It Out was bought as a stocking stuffer at Christmas and as a companion to his in-house microscope. So he could take the Scope it Out outside and explore bugs, plants, dirt, etc.The Scope It Out was a failure. The directions say to adjust the focus by turning the rubber covered eyepiece - which does not do anything. Then to bring things closer or farther into view, just tip the Scope over. We experimented on various items, such as a fingernail, orange peel, bug, etc. It was a joke. I could do better with a magnifying glass. The optics were below poor.I would not recommend this for any one of any age. Don't waste your money."
2,"Science fun!: A great little tool for seeing the normally unseen. Scope easily focuses by tilting the scope rather than fiddling with adjustment knobs. It's so fun to see things really close up!"
2,"Works perfectly but difficult to install: I bought this as a replacement board for a 10 y/o opener. The original board was permanently fastened to the opener chassis and had to be cut off. I then had to drill holes in the side of the opener and fasten the new board with two screws. Unfortunately Liftmaster uses the same exact stock numbers without indicating that there were changes made. In the end it works perfectly but is no job for amateurs."
1,"Absolutely Awful: I find this book is in poor taste, notwithstanding the attempt to put a nice cover on it. Not authorship, but cut and paste out of the Bible. I did the same thing as a kid in CCD. But, make a book out of it? Ugh! An absolutely awful example of using the Bible to sell books. Don't support this kind of thing."
1,"Gross: Ironside themes do not a great album make. Even worse are the puerile child singers - the themes are ghastly and the singing OMG!If you are high on crack this might be cool. Me, I love Archie's music from 62 to 70, this music is CRAP. Strangely, Things Have Go to Change was amazing - Archie you had it in you to be greatImpulse wanted a hit LP this was never going to be it!!!! Archie was misled or not up to say NO!!!!!!"
2,"Dolly's Best Album: I have been a Dolly Parton fan for longer than I can remember. I listened to my cassette with Jolene until I wore it out. This is Dolly Parton's best album ever. Period. There is not a bad song on the record. Her soulful, plaintive ballads contrast with driving bluegrass melodies to create a complete album. There is no way to really explain how good this album is - you just have to experience it for yourself. If you are a fan of Dolly Parton or just bluegrass music in general, you need to buy this album."
2,"Dolly Parton - The Grass is Blue: This is a great CD, especially if you like Bluegrass music and Dolly Parton. What a fantastic combination!"
2,"A timeless masterpiece: I bought ""The Grass Is Blue"" on the strength of the rave reviews which appear below. They didn't lie. This is one of the finest things I have ever heard, from ANY musical genre. I played it for my wife, who has zero bluegrass background, and she was just swept away by it. Every cut is strong, but the odd-numbered tracks appeal to me most, with ""Steady As the Rain"" being a particular highlight. Be warned, ""The Grass Is Blue"" may permanently hijack your musical tastes. Now when I listen to blues and rock standards that used to appeal, I just can't sustain interest for more than a few minutes. Nothing compares to the power, the purity, the soul that Dolly Parton delivers. I am compelled to go back to ""The Grass Is Blue"" for another deep drought of that cool living water. This is one album I never want to live without."
2,"Essential Dolly Parton: Dolly has described this CD as her ""Blue Mountain"" CD. Part Bluegrass, part mountain music. This is as good as it gets. Dolly never fails to deliver and if you are a Dolly fan or a fan of good music in general, you will not be disappointed."
2,"Essential Bluegrass!: Not only am I a fan of Dolly Parton, but a huge fan of bluegrass. Dolly has once again shown her versatility in delivering the essence of bluegrass, and adding so much more with her unique voice and harmonic orchestrations. This album is a buy whether you are a Bluegrass, Dolly Parton, or Folk listener.p.s. I'm still only halfway through my first listening of the album as I'm writing this!"
2,"Magnificent Accomplishment: This is one of those beautiful moments. You know Dolly has been kicking around major labels like a tennis ball. You know that women singers past 40 rarely get airplay. You know Dolly is a wonderful singer whose creative potential has not lessened. You bring home her latest CD on the smaller North Carolina-based Sugar Hill label; and you wonder if her recording career will be reduced to small independent releases. Then you put on the disc. Wow! I like Dolly's philosophy: When all else fails, make one of the best albums of your career. This album is nearly flawless. The steller bluegrass players lend an integrity and enthusiasm which keeps taking Dolly even higher. The songs of spiritual faith are transcendent and not preachy. This is a magnificent accomplishment. If you've like Dolly or bluegrass music, don't miss this marriage of the two. Unforgettable!"
2,"yet another 5 star review...: I'm no great fan of bluegrass or country, but this release intrigued me because - like many people, I suspect - I have a soft spot for Dolly. ""The Grass is Blue"", though, really is as good as the other reviewers have said."
1,"Slick, over-produced bluegrass: I hate to disagree with so many people who love this CD, but I find very little to like about it. I found the ballads weepy, the upbeat songs cliched, and the singing/musicianship professional but uninspiring. To give you an idea of my tastes, my favorites are Nashville Bluegrass Band ""American Beauty"", Steve Earl/Del McCrory Band ""The Mountain"", Ricky Skaggs/Kentucky Thunder ""Bluegrass Rules"". In my opinion, ""The Grass is Blue"" does not approach the artistic standards of these and many other current CD's. Once again, no offense is intended to the many people who are so fond of this CD. The bottom line: I plan on making the day of somebody who wants to own this CD by selling my copy to a used CD store."
1,"Only for the ""Waltons"": I love ya Dolly, but this music is the WHACK, or it is to this city boy! This is a Cd only the Waltons could love!"
2,"The Grass is the Finest!: Dolly reaches out the bluegrass world and hauls in a huge win for herself and the rest of us. Why she didn't sing and stretch like these years ago is beyond me, but she soars along with the hot group of musicians and singers with her. I have been playing this CD for months since I got it and I can't seem to get enough. I would have loved to see her tour with this ensemble of musicians with her, but I think she only played in Nashville last January.Here's to hoping she records more bluegrass, but until then I'll give The Grass is Blue another spin."
2,"dolly can do no wrong: This cd blew my mind the second i listened to it! Dolly knows country like no other and this hould be a lesson to all those tired pop-country acts cramming the airwaves: this is how to do country, bluegrass and any kind of roots music for that matter. her rendition of ""Silver Dagger"" gives me chills. she is just the queen of country."
2,"The best! * * * * * * * * * * 10 Stars!: Dolly Parton, you've done it again! Continue to give us your best. Your adoring fan, Sergio."
2,"Seek no further if you love melancholy music!: This is it. The best, most heartfelt debut I've heard in a long, long while. Lhasa sings of love, rejection, defiance, vanity, birds in the desert, the fish in the river, the tree of forgetfulness, all with a voice that is now sweet as desire, now wrenching as a lover's scorn. The music reminds me alternately of fado, klezmer, cabaret and Kurt Weill. And the girl is only 25. One can only wait with bated breath and hope it won't be too long before the second album appears. Meanwhile, I'll try not to wear out this CD!"
2,"Just incredible!: How a young female singer from Quebec (with mexican parents I believe) could do a so powerful album! This album must be know around the world. You'll love this CD at the first second you listen to it... maybe 2 ou 3, but no more! The music is so good, it makes you sing or dance! Lhasa has only one album now, but she's working on an other actually. Don't miss it, don't pass beside this one, it would be a mistake."
2,"Amazingly Beautiful: I own over 800 CD's and this is my first review on line. This haunting performance showers you with romance and poetry; she holds your heart and reshapes it with lasting passion. Thank you Ms. De Sela"
2,"Probably The Best Canadian release in this decade!!!!: Less than a year ago I saw maybe a 30 sec. of one of her songs on MuchMusic, and I was...amased. I remembered her name, and soon I saw her perform live in Toronto on two occasions. MAGIC!!! I picked up a copy of her CD, and it's one of my favourite albums EVER. Beautiful!!! I'm allways on the lookout for interesting artists, being one myself, and I've been involved in the music industry for a long time working in a recording studio. I can't tell you ""Buy This"" because I think it is great-that's a personal opinion. But I can tell you ""Buy this"" because I like it and so will you, and anyone else you play it to. And if you ever have a chance to see her perform live, DO IT. It was the most intimate performance I ever saw artist deliver on stage. And her band shines with her."
1,"Too much noise for nothing?: Reading the numerous exalting critiques of this new CD by Lhasa, I finally gave in and bought it... I have to admit, that the exoticism of the ""haunting"" style of interpretation can be captivating to the ones not familiar with the Mexican or Latin-American musical traditions. However, the various musical styles appropriated in this CD merit greater diversity in interpretation."
1,"Not better than Chavela Vargas but certainly prettier: After all these reviews, it is difficult to not feel like I would be doing an injustice ... yet, I think that those who claim to like Lhasa would much prefer the originality and talent of Chavela Vargas. Indeed, Lhasa's raspy voice is deeply influenced by the cigarrette-smoking Vargas. What is called haunting voice, or passion, by other reviewers, is a mode of interpretation that Lhasa administers indiscriminately to every song in her repertoire, especially when the CD includes merry Chrismas songs."
1,"Frida's more attractive soundtrack sister: Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful."
1,"Disappointing: One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."
2,"A CD engulfed in GREATNESS !: This CD is amazing. Lhasa and her band demonstrate top musicianship combined with abundant passion. If you are a music fan with a large collection and taste of music, you must add this CD to your collection. It will be among your top 10 favorites. And that goes for music fans with modest CD collections too! And if you get a chance to see them perform live they are even better. I saw her last year in Montreal. Wow!"
2,"Perfect background music: I recently heard this tape being played in a shop abroad, and immediately enquired what it was and ordered it from Amazon the moment I returned home. The music is very different and extremely haunting. I have played the tape non-stop and it is perfect background music as it does not disturb ones thoughts at all. I have played it while writing my Christmas cards, and will most certainly look at the other tapes made by Lhana who has a most unusual voice.The rhythm is wonderful and I'm sure would make good party music. Do not be put off by the rather spooky cover painting!!"
2,"Majestic: This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible, sexy, and captivating. So subtle in its beauty, it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart. I am not fluent in Spanish, but the music totally gets inside your skin. Beautiful arrangements, beautiful melodies, beautiful voice. It can only make your life better."
2,"A fun-filled fantasy adventure: ""Castle"" is a wonderful book for children who have short attention spans. It provides adventure and re-affirms the laws of chivalry."
2,"Very fun book: This is a fun book because it is about life in a diminute world sharing times with knights, servants, other different people and Alabaster, the small world wizard."
2,"The Castle in the Attic: This book is amazing. I read it when I was a child and couldn't put it down. It has amazing adventure and suspense, without the horrible violence. Several months ago, something reminded me of the book and I had to hunt it down. I had forgotten the title and the author(it had been 15 years since I read it). I finally was able to locate it. I was thrilled. I bought it and read it in just a couple of hours. It is a book I recommend for both children and adults."
2,"One of my favorite books as a kid.: This ought to be required reading for every boy or girl between the ages of 8-12. Enjoyable, readable, exciting, and above all, heart-warming."
2,"Audio Version: Fun book. Young boy, 10, is given a toy castle by his nanny who is leaving to go back to England. The boy, William, is very upset that Mrs. Phillips is leaving. When he discovers that the castle, or more accurately, the Silver Knight that comes with it, is enchanted, he devises a plan to keep her with him. And thus begins a very satisfying tale of fantasy and heroism.I listened to the audio version of this book - read by the author along with an entire cast. I can't say it was the best audio book I've ever listened to. As often is the case, the reading by the author, while interesting, wasn't great. And it wasn't just the author. I often kept thinking to myself that I wish I had opted to read this one instead of listening to it."
1,"Very Disappointed: As a teacher, I've enjoyed using this book over the years in my reading program. Imagine my excitement when I learned that the book is on audio. Please understand, the book is worth ten stars, and I really love the story. It is very well written, the characters are fleshed out and believable. BUT... the audiobook is a great disappointment. It is read by the author with a full cast. Somebody forgot to tell Mrs. Phillips that she is from England, and, therefore, has a british accent. The woman reading her part sounded like she is from Iowa. Almost from the beginning I'm listening to audio and I'm going HUH!? This is what happens when you don't pay attention to your own production. I'm amazed that Winthrop allowed this lemon to get out, especially since she is reading on it. Go Figure!"
2,"I liked the book because...: I liked the book Castle In The Attic because it was a book on a Dragon and a Knight. My three favorite parts were when William climbed the tree and got the apple for the cursed man. My other one was when he fought the dragon,and my last one was when William fought Alastor.Other kids should read this book so they will be more interested in reading the sequel Battle For The Castle."
1,"I was very disappointed because the cds are stratched and they skip.: I rated this one star because the cds are stratched and they skipped all through the story. I would have sent it back, but I was so sure I could depend on this company. I threw away the returned information. I will have to purchase another CD before I use the novel with another class.I am very disappointed and I will think twice before I order again.Thank you for the opportunity to share.Gloria Gilliard"
2,"Thi was a great book: My class read the book The Castle in The Attic My whole class liked the book. My favorate part was when Willam got past the dragon.But did he get in the castle? I don't know! You will have to read the book to find out. I recommend you read this book!!!!"
2,"I like this book.: The book Castle in the Attic is a good book.My favorite part is when william defeated Alastor. There was one other good part in Castle in the Attic. When William was trying to get to Alastors kingdom and the dragon was distracting him with bad visions. I recommend this book to anybody who likes exciting books."
2,"Saving the Past And returning to the Present: This book is about a boy who gets a toy castle as a gift and working with a knight going from the present into the past saving a old town from a evil ruler(Alastor).The town was saved and they wanted the knight and the boy to rule their town but the boy refuses and goes back to the present and the knight stays to protect the town from any other evil rulers."
2,"I liked it: I love the way Elizabeth Winthrop describes his emotions about Mrs. Phillips leaving. It was exiting and I couldn't put it down!"
2,"An incredible piece of work!: This book, by Elizabeth Winthrop was one of the best books I've ever read. It was a real page turner! The end of every chapter left me wanting to read on. If you love fantasies too, I strongly recommend you pick up this one today!"
2,"Very fun to read: My family and I listened to this book on tape when we were driving across the country. It was so fun we didn't want to turn it off. It's about a boy who figures out what's in your heart mattters most. It has a great moral and is very exciting. I recommend this book for everyone."
2,"Great kids story: This story is a great one involving magic, different worlds, knights and all the things that make fairy tales great. Any child who likes to read and has an active imagination will like this story. Geared a little more for boys, but I think most girls would appreciate it just as much. This was a favorite at our house growing up and is already on my son's bookshelf, though he is a little too young for it just yet."
2,"One of my childhood favorites!: I am 26 years old and I still remember reading this book as a child. I have always loved castles, so the castle layout diagram at the beginning of the book really made me happy and drew me into the world. The cover is different on my edition, so I hope the diagram is still there in this latest printing. I was an avid reader as a child, and I highly recommend this book!"
2,"Both my daughter and son enjoyed this book.: It's not overly long, and it's written in simple enough language that my 8 and 9 year old children had no trouble reading it.It's a very engaging, sweet story, which introduces the concepts of chivalry and bravery. I actually think this book is very good for boys to read - it's about knights and fighting for one's honor, and demonstrating loyalty, but it's also about being able to cry when you need to, and being able to express love for others.In this story, the little boy's nanny is moving away, because he's growing up and doesn't need her, and he has some trouble accepting this. I think it's a wonderful, simple way to address some of the issues all children face when approaching their teenage years.I definitely recommend this one to parents and children."
2,"The Castle in the Attic: In the beginning, William is an ordinary boy, but when his toy knight comes alive, and William shrinks, the adventure begins. This book was one of the best books I've ever read. And anyone with a big imagination and a love for adventures will love this book too."
1,"The Castle in the Attic: i read the castle in the attic and i thoght it wasn't very entrtaning. but that's just my opinion. i thought on some of the chapters it dragged on and lost me alot. like it would talk about one thing and then another without alot of detail. for my opinion, it was an ok book. it had it's moments like whats going to happen next then it was really boring."
1,"Castle in the attic: This book was dull non for feeling non inspiring boring made no sense. I would not recomended this book to a friend it is terrible. I rather read something else rather than this book"
1,"My review: The Castle in the Attic was about a 10 year old boy named William who lives with his mom and dad in Pennsylvannia. And he has a baby sitter that stays with him for 13 years and desides to go back to her home in England. William doesnt want her to go so he takes her picture of her husband who died in the world war 2. She finds out and is said for him and gives William a go away gift which was a huge toy castle with a led knight."
2,"I like this book!: I like the book Castle In the Attic because it was very adventurous. My favorite part in the book was when Mrs.Philips gave William a gift. Do you know what the gift was? Can you figure out what it is? I recommend this book because Castle In the Attic is a very exciting novel to read."
2,"This was a great book: I read the book The Castle in the Attic and I really enjoyed it. My favorite part was when William meets Sir Simon and sees the castle. I like this part because William gets scared and drops him on the floor. Will they become friends or not? Find out by reading the book."
2,"We Love This Book!: My son and I had checked this book out from the public library and he loved it! He was so upset when we had to take it back so I decided to look online. We love Mexican food/culture and he thinks it's so funny after knowing the original song!I was so happy to have found it for his birthday!"
1,"small: The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.The shoes are still too small.."
2,"Soon to be a best seller!: All of Mr Lepp's stories speak to me on a primal, fundamental level, in a place that brings me back to my life as a child.... shyeeha right! Honestly folks, Bil is one of the best guys i have ever met, and his stories have had me rolling with laughter more than once. He and his wife Paula and both salt of the earth, good people, and their belief in God, and the fundamental goodness of Mankind are reasons enough to own this book! Someday, you'll be glad you did!"
2,"Bubble Gum Crisis: This music CD went along fairly well with the action and theme seen in the show, Bubble Gum Crisis. I guess that kind of figures, as it's the sound track for the show, but it was very good. I'm not a music critic, but that is my opinion. If you were a fan of the show, this CD is a must-have."
2,"tobacco pouch: The material and workmanship is excellent, the ""plastic"" zipper pulls aren't good.They broke the first time used and I replaced them with metal ones. Could use a better quality for these, otherwise very useful product."
2,"Raise you off your feet!: Wilmington Chester Mass Choir is incredible. I highly recommend this inspirational gospel choir CD. I especially love the song ""Holy, Holy, Holy"", it alone is worth the price of the CD. You can realyy ""feel"" the Lord when you hear thier music, and you know they mean every word and note of it. Thank you Amazon.com for featuring this CD, I had a hard time finding it anywhere else."
2,"Great book!: I really liked this book...it is one of my favorite nightworld books. I think that it was sad that Thea had to leave her family and live with Eric and his mom but I don't think they had much choice.. anyway it's great! And I enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed reading the rest of the Nightworld series..by the way I think that L J Smith is the best!!! Anyway gotta go!!"
2,"Witches Rule!: I'm glad that L. J. Smith finally put a witch book in her series. I love vampires but it wouldn't really be good if that's all she wrote about in the Night World series. Now she needs to put in a shapeshifter novel and she'll be on a roll. The only thing I don't get about the book is why Thea got expelled with Blaise when she didn't do anything. I hope she became a famous vet."
2,"Good Witchy Fun!: This is one of my favorites in the Night World series by LJ Smith. I have a thing for witches, and all the information about actual spells, spell ingredients, circle casting, and witch history was simply fascinating. Thea is a great character, and her relationship with her soulmate Eric is endearing, but the real standout star in this book is Blaise.Blaise seems like your typical wicked witch, but despite her disdain for humans (that's how she was raised so you can't really blame her), she's supremely loyal to her family. What she does in the end for Thea almost made me cry.What I love about LJ Smith's books is that the main themes go much deeper than just supernatural characters; her books explore and highlight the importance of relationships, love and loyalty. Spellbinder is one book I know I'll be reading over and over again for the rest of my life."
2,"Spellbinder is Spellbinding!: Unlike the first two books in the series Spellbinder switches it's romantic connections to witches insted of vampires. Blaise uses human men as toys till they go crazy, and when she sets her eyes on Eric, Thea's soulmate Thea will do anything to protect him, even if it means breaking the laws of the Night World. A great addition to the series that will have you excited to read more. Though it's a step down from Daughters of Darkness it stands well on it's own."
2,"Totally Witchy!: This was actually the 3nd of the Night Worlds I had ever read but I have a different cover and it says Enchantress why???? This was a good book and I liked the spells and particularely Blaise's necklace that was cool.I wonder if yemonja really exists and the other spices.It is true that most of LJSmith's books are with witches and vampires and that we don't know what shapeshifters shape into but I liked the spells anyway.Email me if ya wanna chat."
1,"Cheaply made: First time I tried the extractor, it busted off inside the bolt. Very hard metal, but so hard that it is quite brittle. Very little amount of free play, and doesn't let you put any torque on the bolt at all, so if it is rusted in there, forget about this set! Seems like a cheap knock off of the ever so popular ""easy out"" set.Now I have to figure a way out how to get the stupid thing out of my bolt so I can drill a new hole and tap some new threads in. Can't drill it out because the metal is so hard, it is chewing up my drill bits."
2,"Don't move, vibrate, tilt or press too hard...: I use these at my automotive school, notorious for un-calibrated torque wrenches and people who don't like reading directions. I would go with professional grade set if your working on rusted bolts, or in awkward or tight situations. Otherwise, for light to medium duty work: Buy 2 of these sets to save on shipping. You will need the extra set. The slightest vibration can snap the bits, they are very brittle. Consider your first set a 'learning set'. If you use them to remove another bit that has broken off in a broken screw, they grind into dust (Doh!). These work great on bolts which have been over torqued or snapped on re-install."
1,"Cheap material: This tool is made of cheap material and never work or extract tripped screw. I have tried so many times and eventually have to buy different brand tool to make my work finished"
1,"Wore the drill bit to a nub...: Do not waste your money on this set! After an hour I had worn the smallest drill bit in the set down to a nub trying to drill through a small transmission bolt on my Pontiac Sunfire. I did get the screw extracted, however, the set was worthless by the time I got the screw out. Also, the extractors are weak. One will need a small torch to heat up the metal to loosen screws and bolts to keep from snapping the extractors."

2,"Putting a marriage together again.: Wendie Keith and Teague Blackwell had met on the set of the oldtelevision series, THE LOST ROMANCE RANCH, and fell in love.... As the couple drive on Route 66, they must learn to trust in each other and God.This type of romance will appeal to everyone, even readers who don't normally read ""inspirational"" fiction. God and religion are a part of Teague and Wendie's lives, there is no heavy handed preaching. The Blackwells are normal people with common problems, not saints. This is the first Annie Jones book I have read, but it won't be the last."
2,"Indispensable!: While working on an on-going university research project I have spent five years driving the back roads of India. This book has saved my sanity as well as my tires and axles. It is by far and away the most helpful road atlas available."
1,"too thin to hold weight: this product is good for child I guess..cause it is a little thin...but it is better than the one I saw on sports authority which is thiner"
1,"This is NOT a VHS tape, It's a music CD.: This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away."
1,"Total waste of money: The developers at Eidos really blew it this time. The game is so full of bugs it makes me sick. First of all, the box says nothing about laptop compatability problems, but upon checking the Eidos tech support page, you learn that they won't support laptop systems.Anyways, I installed the software on my desktop. The game crashes every several minutes. I have installed all of the newest drivers and my computer excedes the recommended hardware profile in every way. Gameplay is tolerable, but nowhere near as good as I had hoped it would be. In fact, Chronicles was more fun and was more of a challenge.I ended up returning the game because it is not only not worth the money, but it is also a waste of time. If you do take the gamble, make sure you buy this game from a store that accepts software returns. Good luck!"
1,"STOP. We waited 8 months for THIS ?: I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great. But overall I am very dissapointed. EIDOS, get it right next time."
2,"my game reviews: i enjoyed the game very mutch,i have followed all the layra croft games for years on the play station,playstation one and game cube gameing systems,i am an avid fan of all laura croft tomb raider games."
1,"waste of money!!!!!: Oh man, this is horrible! I'm a Lara junkie, and I'm completely embarassed by this horrid game. The PC controls are a joke, you just seem to spin in circles when you're just trying to make a simple turn. I feel completely ripped off by the folks at Eidos for releasing such a bug filled game. Game locks up at the worst possible moments, cut screnes are too long and dull, just let us play the game without the need to watch a movie every level...put all that energy into fixing the movement controls and lock up issues. Please, don't waste your hard earned cash on this!!! Maybe Eidos will get the message."
1,"Should have waited to release, rather than sacrifice quality: This is, by far, the most bug filled game I have ever played. The new control system is extremely clumsy and will leave Lara die-hards wondering what the developers were thinking when they decided to revamp the old one. I hate to say it, but I think EIDOS was more concerned about not missing another promised release date and sent out an unfinished product; the obvious quality issues are apparent in the first chapter and get progressively worse. I would not be surprised if the company has to issue a recall for this defective product. On a positve note, the improved graphics are beautiful, but are hard to appreciate because of the frustrating gameplay."
1,"Absolutely awful controls! DO NOT BUY: I am a huge fan of the Tomb Raider series, and have played all five other games on my PC. I love them. I was so excited to get this one, and sooooo disappointed with the quality. Glitchy glitchy glitchy. Do not buy this game. The controls are terrible. While all other 5 games play out smoothly, this one is slow, stalls, goes blank some times, and takes minutes to load to new chapters. Now I don't have a fancy schmancy computer, but I have been able to play all the other games on it just fine without any hitch. This is just crap. It makes me feel like I have to go buy a $2000 computer just to be able to play this $30 game! It probably runs better on a PS 2, so if you have one of those don't bother with the PC version. Thanks a lot Eidos, I totally wasted time and money and am warning future buyers to BEWARE!"
1,"i've have more fun taking a dump than playing this crap: what a piece of garbage....just thinking of it is making my bowels move...again....OH GOD, i gotta go back on the bowl!!!! AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Robocop dressed like Lara Croft: I was expecting Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness since last year, with a similar performance as Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, but now when I receive the game, I saw this little girl that walks like with an umbrella inside of her pants.The graphics and sound are great, but Lara rotates like a robot and when I try to make her run, she doesn't agree with me and moves extremely slowly.I have a 2MHz PC with 500Megas RAM and GeForce4 Graphic Card, and there is no possibility that only this game needs to practice Ctrl-Alt-Del each 15 minutes in order to play it.I'll find the way to sell my game and suggest Eidos to make a research in order to define how many of the customers are really satisfied with this game and determine if a refund to the customers is the better way to maintain the good image of Eidos until today.It's a shame."
1,"Don't bother: This game was nothing but glitchy on my PC. I have no problem with a dozen or so other games from other companies (including Deus Ex 2, also from Eidos), but this one is a turkey. It's glitchy, the controls are too clunky, and whenever I exited the game my PC restarted. The built-in EAX support didn't work with my Sound Blaster Audigy 2 (which uses the EAX 4 drivers), I had to install the EAX 3 drivers that came with the game, which was essentially a downgrade for me.On the other hand, this game looks great and when the sound worked it was terrific. The story is pretty cool, and I was looking forward to see how it played out. The cutscenes were good, and I felt like it was as much an interactive movie as it was a game.Unfortunately, I couldn't take the bugginess, so I didn't finish the game. Avoid this one and spend your money on one of the earlier Tomb Raider titles."
1,"Worse than I had previously thought: Spare yourself. Dont waste your money or your time with this game. It's too easy. 30 minutes and I was on the 5th level and never fired a shot. If this is the product they put out after an 8 month delay in release. I cannot imagine how bad this game was before they decided to rework it. I want the original Tomb Raider back. I wasted $... on this game and I know others paid more that I did...."
1,"big disappointment: After waiting months for this game to be released I find that its is essentially unplayable. Although I have a reasonably fast PC 3.06 Ghz and a fair video display, the game is slow and jerky and it crashes or hangs up constantly. Having played all the TR games this is by far the worst. I will be trying to get my money back on this one. If you haven't already bought it don't waste your time or your money."
2,"Tomb Raider Angel of Darkness (PC Version): I purchased & played the PC version of Tomb Raider. This version has 2 CDs and both are required to install. The program will recognize your USB controller and will display it on the options screen. You can configure each button to your choice. I recommend that you use a Ten button controller. The directional control is a bit sensitive so be careful not to send Lara over the rail or short fence and have her fall to her demise. The graphics are a big imporovement from the previous versions and the animation is very smooth. The game play is much like the same as the previous five but there are a few new moves to become familiar with. I highly recommend purchasing the PC version it seems that EIDOS has made some improvements to the controls for the PC. Thank you EIDOS!"
1,"Do Not Buy This Game: Inspite of the two patches offered by Eidos the game crashed very often. Lara's movements are hard to control and choppy in stairwells. You will be nothing but disappointed if you spend your hard earned money on this game."
1,"Don't waste your money: I bought this game at a reduced price and still feel like I got ripped off. The controls in the PC version are an absolute nightmare and make what could have otherwise been a decent game horrible. Sometimes you feel like you have no control whatsoever. Good thing two successful movies have been made about this game otherwise EIDOS would've been out of business with this horrendous offering. In fact I'll think twice before purchasing anything with the EIDOS name or CORE DESIGN name attached to it."
1,"Do not purchase this game!: Let me give you some advice that will keep you from pulling your hair straight out of your scalp... stay away from this game. Don't take just my word for it... alot of folks here feel the same way. Do not listen to those that tell you that all this game needs is a killer machine to run. Believe me, I have a good machine and the controls are still awful! You get tired of yelling at Lara, telling here to get her butt up them stairs! People around you will think your nuts for screaming at the screen. Laura has never looked better, that is true. The graphics on this game are amazing. It's sure nice to look at, that is for sure. But, even if had a ghost of a chance of making Laura go were you wante her to go, you'd still have to deal with bugs, freezes, Laura walking on air, and attrocious angels. Do yourself a favor... stay away."
1,"when is this game going to be released??: I can hardly wait for this game and now another disappointment,why don't they be truthful and say when for sure so I can get on with some other game..just waiting with baited-breath, and how long will we have to wait for another after this one,, they need to get with it before I outgrow my need for Laura and I'm only 75 , can't wait much longer, if you know what I mean!!!"
1,"This [stinks]: I will have to assume this game is going [to stink] Why would it's release be pushed back a third time? I am tired of waiting. This game must be so bad that Eidos/Core must feel it needs some severe refinement before release.On top of the release date changes, neither Eidos or Core have bothered to put the news up on thier sites. ..."
1,"Tomb Stinker - Eidos' Revenge: Cutting edge technology does not a great game make. This game is proof.The graphics are beautiful, which accounts for the extra star for the overall rating. If you are a Tomb Raider fan, you will absolutely hate this game, as I do. The controls, the plot, and the movements are maddening, boring and confusing, respectively. Eidos could plug Tomb Raider 1 into this engine and have a much more interesting game.Maxim magazine gave this game 5 stars. A good reason to ignore Maxim's ratings."
1,"Great graphics but no!: I must say when i first heard that TR angel of darkness was coming out i wanted it so bad but after when i beat the game it turned out to be a stupid adventure and im a true fanatic on tomb raider. So far TR 1 TR2 are the best but i hope tomb raider legend will be good i saw the previews it looks good! she actually explores temples i mean whats the purpose of calling it tomb raider when your not in any tombs like tomb raider chronicals! another thing in tomb raider angel of darkness- what the hell happened to her pistols? the only weapons you use are just one pistol gun not 2 , eidos better get it going because the tomb raider franchise is going to the dumps!"
2,"EXCELLENT!: Tomb Raider: The Angel of Darkness is one of my favorites. The plot is very interesting, the graphics are good (but kind of shakey, at least on my computer), and it's pretty cool to be able to play another character (although Lara is always the best). The environment is very dark and grimacing though, and I find that if I play the game to much, I get a little depressed. It's still one of the best, though, and an awesome addition to the Tomb Raider series."
1,"Looks Great - plays horribly: This game has absolutely gorgeous graphics and sound, but it is incredibly hard to play. The controls are demented, the camera viewpoints imbecilic. If they had spent a small amount more on making this game playable, it would have been a smash hit. As it stands, this game is not worth the sticker price. I am a long time Tomb Raider fan and I will probably still play this game, but it is just not much fun at all."
1,"unusable controls, graphics glitches.: I LOVE the tombraider line. I waited for this game with bated breath......And it was absolutely horrible. :(The controls are so bad, the game is virtually unplayable -- they're sluggish beyond belief! No more fast-paced running & jumping. I literally had to STOP MOVING, in order to perform side jumps! (doesn't work well, when you're being chased by a ball of flame, from an explosion behind you)It crashes randomly.There's graphics glitches all over the place.Should've known it was crap, when the release date kept getting moved back. /sighNote to self: read the reviews before buying another TR game./lms"
1,"Bad Eidos, Bad!: Oh. My. God. I remember when Tomb Raider first came out, and my husband and I got it on the original PlayStation. It was great, for 1995. We got Angel of Darkness for our computer, and WHOA! It looked like Eidos had REGRESSED! The animation is choppy, jumps (basically all moves, in general) are hard to control and judge, and I read on a review for the PS2 version that you'd better come to love the phrases ""save successful"" and ""load successful"" because that's what you'll do, over and over and over! It's completely ridiculous how bad the game looks and plays. Holy cow, and the Glitches! At one point in the church, if you move Lara to JUST the wrong spot then the game gets stuck on the two boxers in the ring fighting, and you have to reboot the computer to get out of it! This game wasn't even worth the discounted price I picked it up for. Don't buy it, it's a trick..."
1,"So far, it's not worth $...: My Tomb Raider game is filled with bugs! Within 10 minutes of downloading it, I had to restart my computer 3 times! When the game does show up, I get a blank screen. I can hear the sounds and all but there are no pictures! Whatever I do I cannot get it to work. I've tried so many websites for help! I've waited a year for this and now I wish I didn't get it. Maybe it's just my game? But other people have been having the same problems too. Well, at least the box is cool. |=("
2,"Lara croft, angel of darkness: The graphics on this game are really really good.A big downer is the controls, it used to be really easy but now you`ve got no choice but to use the anolog buttons and i hate them!The locations are very detailed and the interaction of friends and enemies is very impressive.But, i`m not sure that it was a good idea to bring in another character.overall, a very good game worth the money, v.good graphics and locations. The only set backs to this game are the controls, and the extra character."
1,"NOT IMPRESSED: Just got the game....NOT IMPRESSED! These 5 star reviews must have been written by the makers of the game, cuz this player thinks it [stinks]. Lara's movements are slow and chunky. Movements that used to be simple, such as jump back to get a run forward, has turned into spin Lara around, walk, and spin around again...and since this changes your view of the surroundings it's easy to get confused (camera angles [stink] too) Lara's control is a nuisance and it's NOT worth my time to play this game."
1,"One would think.........: Hmmmm, as a veteran of Tomb raider and an someone who plays most of the 1st person shooters that appear I was quite disappointed in the game controls. The story is great, the graphics are much better then previous Tomb Raider releases but the controls ruined the game for me. One would think with all the 1st person shooters with very precise and smooth controls Tomb Raider would have them too, not so. It is very frustrating to try and play a very well done story only to continually die for lack of the ability to accurately control Lara's movement. I hope Edios learns from this experience."
1,"Come on here people...: This control sceme made Tomb Raider 1 unplayable. This control scheme kept me from passing the TRAINING levels of TR: Last Revelations. This control scheme was horrible but barely useable when I played Resident Evil. This control scheme caused me to die like a thousand times on the first level when I played Fear Effect. This control scheme is still compleyely horrible in this game.Would someone please tell Eidos to change the controls in any future Tomb Raider games. I really want to like this series but every one of these games has been unplayable due to the control scheme."
2,"No Game Play Problems On My Machine: Game A+ On Sound TrackA+ On GraphicsA+ On Story LineI haven't had any of the problems that other's have reported like Slow-mo Lara, Audio drop out, Lara Falling out of the game World. To sum it up Tomb Raider AOD is a Best-Buy"
2,"Exceeds expectations: This is my 3rd pressure washer and by far the best of the breed. It is solid piece of work that is easy to move about when doing the deck(s)with wheels that actually work. Santa gave me the one with the roll-up hose which is very nice feature. Only problem was that the User guide didn't have any information on this feature so I spent a few minutes trying to figure out where or how to connect the high pressure hose to unit- Guess What? - No need to connect anything except garden hose. I consider this tool the best buy for your $$$$"
2,"Gets the job done: It does an excellent job on mildewed wood such as decks and deck furniture without using chemical mode which is the only weak link in an otherwise strong chain. Unfortunately, the only effective chemical solution is chlorine which acts more or less on its own but cannot be used with this machine. Safe cleaners, such as Simple Green are no more effective than when used without them. Other than that, it's a great product."
1,"Do not buy this Brand!!!: I was originally pleased with the make of the washer but the connector between the washer and hose broke, when i ordered the replacement parts it took them over 1 ""YEAR"" to get the replacement parts to me. That is not a typo and i find it ignorant that it took that long to replace a plastic part that they should have had mass produced with plenty of spares. Do not buy, the customer service is horrible and the machine breaks easily, not to mention to get it fixed takes a year."
1,"Piece of CR--AP - try calling their support !: Got this JUNK from the Thank You network. It failed even the assembly test - the thing is so badly manufactured that the connection to which the pressure hose connects on the body of the washer was completely misaligned. There was no way I could connect the nozzle. OK - I thought it happens. I tried to call their 1-800-521-8559 support number and was on hold for 42 Minutes both on the Customer Service and Sales lines and then they cut me off. I did not even talk to a human! Their website is a joke. This is a typical bottom of the barrel Chinese company trying to dump poorly built stuff on the consumer. DO NOT BUY this and encourage such companies that dont give a hoot about the customer.I'm returning this and telling every retailer to dump this.AM"
1,"Cheap Plastic Parts, Poor Quality: This machine does a decent job of cleaning when it works, but it breaks way to easily for the price, and its not built well enough to justify fixing. Too many cheap plastic parts. Consider it to be disposable if you buy it."
1,"Worked at first: When we got this product it worked great. After a year though, the pressure is next to non-existent and I cannot find a troubleshoot guide to find out what the problem is, or how to fix it. I consider myself very handy and can usually figure these things out, but this one has me stumped. It acts like there is air getting into the system and the result has been damage to the motor or something.The company is absolutely no help at all in advice for fixing this machine.Sorry, but I cannot recommend it as highly as those who are doing so."
2,"McCulloch 1800 PSI Electric Pressure Washer: I like it. I live on the west side of the Cascade Range in Oregon and things get dingy pretty quick. I had my vehicle, the rain gutters on the house, landscaping bricks along the path around the house, and odds and ends all washed in about an hour. It works great. The only drawback that I can find is that it doesn't appear to suck up any cleaning solution in the high pressure mode. Only the low pressure. I haven't tried the upper tank yet so maybe that's the problem. Not a huge issue since plain water pretty much takes everything off anyway. The plastic double male hose attachment was a concern before I purchased the unit. I'd read that most of them broke pretty quick. As long as you are aware not to stress it out dragging it around, it will probably last a good long time. If it does break it should be easy to replace pretty cheap. Again great unit so far."
1,"failed after 2nd application: i never got this to work, it shorted out and is made out of cheap plastic. didn't come with all the attachments would not recommend this product"
1,"Kindle Buyer Beware!: Find another version for ebookery, or go hard copy on this one. The table of contents, like the print version, organizes Poe's work into general categories, but stops there. Absent is a listing of the stories themselves, which is available in the print version. Navigating to a particular story requires you to do a search. Penguin charges a premium for a poor publishing job here."
2,"Good Introduction....: Well-made book. Informative with excellent photography. The overall layout is quite conducive to interrupted reading - easy to pick up and start anywhere."
2,"Excellent Introduction to Philosophy Text: If you teach Introduction to Philosophy using a historical approach, this is the text I recommend. I used ""The Philosophic Classics 2nd edition, From Plato to Nietzsche"" for my classes and was looking for a text with the same basic works with some more contemporary materials. I find the updated 3rd edition, ""From Plato to Derrida"" the perfect solution. Instead of having to look through more textbooks for the right stuff, this is it."
2,"Who thought philosophy would be fun??: Great study of major philosophies that have impacted our western culture. Very enjoyable and easy reading, yet stimulating and intellectual...Loved the book!"
2,"Fast and in good shape: It Came to me pretty fast and was in good shape when I opened it. Very happy with it. Thanks"
2,"Philosophic Classics: There is a huge range of authors in this book, and it includes most of the main ideas from each original passage. It can be sort of hard to follow at times, however, as it leaves out giant parts of arguments, especially in The Republic. This really breaks down the flow of the piece and renders it much more confusing than the original book."
2,"REMASTER 2012! GOTTA HAVE IT!: So, what I've always wanted was a clean digitally remastered version of ""Pom Pom Play Girl"" in MONO! The stereo is rechanneled with Carl singing on one channel and the guys singing on the other! The Mono ""FUN, Fun, Fun is also a ""Must Have"" in Mono to get the full benefit of Brian's Vocal. The music and vocals are very clean on this CD. The gatefold packaging is a bit weak without any details on the songs but still an overwhelming experience for anyone who enjoys surf music."
2,"Read this book!: This is one of my favorite fishing books. I'm reading it now for the third time. It's about a lifestyle that would make most of us jealous. If you enjoy surf fishing, then this book is a must."
1,"You can skip this one: This is not one of Daignault's better books, it reads like some poorly written nostalgic ego trip, with way too many paragraphs about beating out the regulations on beach buggy laws and surf casting that were put in place in the Cape in the 1970s. The title does certainly does not belie its contents: you indeed feel like it's been 20 years of Daignault on the Cape by the time you're finished reading it."
2,"The Way is Was: Great look at the past of striped bass fishing on the Cape. Money, politics and fishing competition made this a great read for the avid bass angler. A time never to be visited again. The man became intergrated into the life cycle of the striped bass. As the seasons and years changed , so did the man, so did the politics, so waned the competition, so lost was the inner workings of his family. A time to remember and a time remember less."
1,"Guess i missed what was cool: I bought this thinking that it was going to be one of those major life-changing experience moments in horror or something. As i said in my title... I guess i missed what was cool. It was ok for a low budget, but even then i guess i just didn't like the story, concept or style of the movie at all. People running down an alley flailing their arms does not invoke terror to me... sorry. So i suppose this movie ranks as a: Either you hate it or Love it kinda thing. Watch a trailer, if you like what you see go for it."
2,"Accurate Bio of the Young Henry McCarty: This book is the most accurate that I have read concerning the earlier years of Billy, Starting with the arrival of his mother in New York City, fleeing the Irish Potato famine. I would recommend reading this important book along with the Billy book writen by Robert Utley, ""Billy the Kid, A Short and Violent Life."""
1,"not what i expected: being a wolverine fan ; this is nothing like i expected. really don't like the drawing or storyline. looks fake."
1,"Very poor vision of Wolverine: I have seen an episode of this show and all I could say is WOW, what a travesty. This show is completely not Wolverine. First Logan is Canadian not Japanese, short not tall, older looks middle aged even though much older not like a teenager. Voice acting is poor. This show is the William Shatner of Wolverine, extreme over acting and over dramatized action sequences. This is supposed to be Marvel Comics Wolverine not a Wolverine DragonBall Z. If they want to make a good Wolverine Cartoon keep it on par with the comics both in the character models and story, and use voice actors that have worked in the past, and if you really want to do Wolverine Justice make it a Mature rated cartoon and show Blood in the battles."
2,"American Pharmacy in the 1800s: Because of its extensive bibliography and excellent index, this biography of William Procter, Jr., serves well as an introduction to the origins of professional pharmacy in the USA.For more information about the book and its topic, contact the American Institute of the History of Pharmacy (AIHP)."

2,"Beautiful little Bible -- anglicised no problem for me: I am very picky about the typography in my Bibles--and for its small size this beautiful little Bible is very easy to read. I have the Burgundy Leather Bound edition which is beautifully bound and finished. This is the aforementioned ""anglicised"" version--I do want to counter the review above by saying that I don't find the differences troublesome at all. There are very few discrepancies between this and my ""regular"" NRSV..."
2,"Nice alarm: So much about carbon monoxide poisoning these days..decided to get a few alarms for protection. Easy to install and work great..."
2,"Good???: It looks good, but we never had carbon monoxide in our place yet, so we can't tell if it works or not. The red light is on when we plug it in. And it works when we press the test button."
2,"Ordered battery operated, got plug in: works fine. Easy to install. Discreet. Directions were easy to understand. We got this because we have a gas fireplace and wanted to be safe. I ordered a battery operated alarm because I wanted more options of where to place it other than being commited to an electrical outlet. However, what was shipped was the electrical kind. I decided to keep it because you know the hassle of returning wasn't worth it and it does it's job."
2,"CO Alarm: Product received timely. The plug in feature is favorable in that there is no concern of battery failure. Product is easy to use."
1,"Not UL Listed ""what's up with that..."": I bought this first alert CO alarm for my home in Wisconsin.When I started to read the instructions I found that this product is not UL list! How can a safety item like this not be UL listed.I did some research and found out first alert changed testing labs to save a few bucks and do not use the most well known UL. What's up with that...So I returned this CO and purchased the Kidde KN-COB-DP-H Plug-In Carbon Monoxide Alarm. The Kidde unit cost less too, so I saved a few dollars! Always pays to READ THE FINE PRINT."
2,"Easy, inexpensive peace of mind.: Takes more time to cut open the box than it does to plug in. Just plug it in, hold the test button, stick your fingers in your ears so you don't do deaf, and your all done. I've used First Alert products for many years, and they just work. They do wear out (5-7 years), but they will alert you when that time comes, usually with a chirping, like other detectors do.Simple, easy to use, no fuss peace of mind unit. Plug it in near air vents in bedrooms or just in open ares for non-living quarters and that's it!"
1,"Broke after first day of use: Got hot and smelled like burning ozone after plugging in. A dissapointing product, never got any real use out of it. Do not recommend."
2,"Easy to use, trusted: After opening the package, I simply plugged this in to a wall socket (making sure that it is not near a heating source, gas, moving air, dust or sunlight). I tested it, the alarm rang loud and clear. A red light lets me know that it is functional.I feel better having it in my house."
2,"Everyone needs one: These CO detectors are mandatory in many states now. I happen that the man who cleans my carpets is the Captain of the town fire dept (also up for promotion to chief), and he always points out my fire hazards or things I do or don't really need to do. I had my first CO detector up on the ceiling next to my smoke detector. He told me it di not need to be on the ceiling, and it's easier to get a plug in one so you don't have to worry about the battery aspect. Then incidentally my ceiling one broke somehow. So I bought this one, plugged it in, in the hallway near my bedroom......he said to do that so you can hear it quickly, and loudly. It's doing it's thing. A little pricey, but actually one of the cheaper ones. He approved!"
1,"Burned outlet: I've had my unit for about a year. It was plugged into a wall outlet. Today I noticed that the unit was on the floor and that the outlet was scorched. The unit itself was burned around the prongs. There have been no power surges/outages, etc., so the only conclusion is that the unit itself is faulty. I'm grateful that it didn't start a house fire."
1,"Defective product: We bought this item twice. The first time, it was defective and wouldn't work (it made a dull sound all the time, and no additional sound at all when put in contact with water, as per the test described on the instructions sheet), so we returned it to Amazon (thanks for your excellent returns policy!) for an exchange. When the 2nd item proved just as defective, we got our money back. Don't waste your money on this junk -- buy something more expensive and substantial."
2,"very good product: Great product. i gave this product to my son and i feel much better that he and his family are safer from carbon monoxide. thanks."
2,"Feel Safer Now: I was looking for a Carbon Monoxide alarm that was reasonabally priced, and was glad to find this one on Amazon.The reviews on Amazon were why I purchased this one. I tested the alarm, which works well, and hope I never actually need it!!Thanks Amazon for having it!"
2,"co2 review: Rec'd co2 alarm 2 weeks ago. It seems to be working fine. Feel much better having this new alarm installed as our last one was no longer functioning."
2,"Good product.: Seems to work as advertised. I opted for the non-battery back up, as my heating system has electric blower, so if power goes, heating system does not opearate. Battery/non-battery an individual judgment.Pros: ""ready light"" is not so bright as to be disturbing at night, if it is a visible location, as mine is; simple plug in operation; you can test alarm manually.Cons: its a bit larger than it looks in the pictures, so depending on where you mount it, might be unappealing to actually see the unit installed in a highly visible wall outlet. Instructions indicate not to mount behind curtains, etc. as air flow might be restricted. However, I could not find a ""micro"" unit.Observations: Obviously no safe method to test if the unit actually detects CO.Suggestion: put a pass-through female outlet in the unit, as it uses one plug in the typical wall outlet, and this feature would be helpful in a older home with fewer wall outlets."
2,"Does the Job: I just plugged it in and it's on the job. Perhaps it would be more assuring if it had a digital read-out of level of monooxide in the air."
1,"weird notification beeps: This went off in the middle of the night after my husband and I had had it for several years. We had to look up online the directions because it didn't have a clear beep for a warning and for a battery replacement. It was ridiculous. I would not recommend it. I want one that clearly tells me when to vacate the house and call the fire department."
1,"My bad, but theirs too: It did not even occur to me that a plug-in CO detector would not have battery back-up, which is my fault for missing that. However, what the?? I mean, they ALL should have batter back-up. This one has to go back."
1,"Don't Bother: I would not recommend this product. When I plugged it in, it would not stop chirping. The directions said it might chirp ""a few times"" while powering up, but the thing chirped all day. Also, the 9 volt battery that came with the product did not fit into the battery compartment. The company that I bought it from told me to just throw it away, although I did receive a full refund."
2,"No Brainer!: I chose this alarm because it was the easiest to use. Just plug it in and that's it. I have a gas fireplace and was told that I needed a carbon monoxide detector. Plugged into a regular outlet, it has a dim light to let you know that it's working and you can test the monitor at any time to make sure it's ""alarmed."" Hopefully, I'll never have to see how well the monitor works in an emergency but I feel safer knowing that I have one."
2,"Carbon Monoxide Alarm: I feel that these are a necessity especially if you live in colder winter climates where you may have the windows closed for a few months.I prefer this model as it plugs in to an outlet rather than battery operated units.I found the models through Amazaon were several dollars cheaper than stores around my area."
2,"does what it's supposed to do: easy set up, working great - no complaints to far. it was nice to find one so cheap! we'll see how long it lasts..."
1,"WARNING: This is not an instructional video!!: I bought this video from Lullabot as soon as it was released. I've managed several Drupal projects and am now diving in to development myself. I was very disappointed, this video has no instructional content whatsoever. It is a very (very) high level view of what Drupal is. I give it two stars for good production value, only.I am hoping this is the first in a series of videos that will dive deeper into Drupal."
1,"tripod sony: This tripod is out of production, although I bougth it because the price and the need of lanc connection for my camcorder Sony DSR PD170, was the only model with a reasonable price. The desadvantage is that it can not hold stablity for the camcorder, too light, not enough hight, and the locks for the vertical and horizontal moves are not good enough, you loose in trying to loose or tight the buterfly nuts. The only advantage is the remote controller and the price. I hope Sony can improve it like the next level but with more confortable price."
1,"Cheap along with poor customer service: I purchased this item to replace a broken hose. It took the seller over 3 weeks to ship the item, even though the tracing website always showed a different and incorrect shipping date. Upon receipt the product looked nothing like the product on the website. The handle was completely different. In addition, the hose was BLACK and not white as the picture showed. I contacted the seller to replace the item with the proper hose. After several phone calls back and forth, the seller claimed he knew which hose we needed and would ship it that day. I called back 5 days later to find out that the item hadn't even been shipped yet. We requested a refund and got our money back promptly, however it still left us without the hose we needed. So basically, over 5 weeks after ordering the item we still did not have a replacement. What made matters worse, is that we were stuck paying almost $40.00 in return charges, which were not covered by the seller. AVOID THIS SELLER!"
2,"The truth: This book will take you to another uncomfortable space where your believes and ideas of spirituality will change. Change is necessary if you want to know."
1,"False: I have read alot of Krishnamurti,Probably the greatest teacher I have came across,But this book is no better than Humpdy dumpty or the Bible, If it is K which I very much doubt he must have been very immature to write this hollow meaningless stuff.His other works are consistant and valuable, among the most valuable words ever written,This book has less wisdom than the average person on the street"
1,"Don't buy this: Krishnamurti himself asked people not to pay attention to his immature teachings (prior to about 1933). For a scholar this book gives a look into K's mind as a youngster but it doesn't portray the important elements of his teachings which flourished after around 1933."
2,"Pretty Straight-Forward: This was one of the very first things I crocheted. The gusset was a little confusing until I realized the gusset illustration was in the beginning of the booklet. My socks came out great and my mom is already asking for a second pair, so I'll probably try a different style."
1,"Ordered 2; Both Chains Were Tarnished and Pendants Scratched!: I have generally had very good experience ordering jewelry from Amazon sellers, so I ordered two of these necklace pendants, one for myself and one for my mother. Both arrived with very badly tarnished chains (about half the chain rust colored on both). In addition, the actual pendants were scratched and ""used looking""."
1,"OMG! this Movie is too wierd to be watched sober.: I think it deserves the one star. maybe even 2 if I was drunk.... but I was'nt! Oh God, how I wish I had been. I can't tell you why I kept watching after the first half hour. I guess I expected it to become something .. ummm good..! quite an unusual film. if you watch it please tell me what you thought of it and what you think I missed. I don't watch Mexican movies ever..! & now I think I know why.... they make my brain all mushy and then it pours out of my ears and I fall over dead and brainless! OMG.. and the last 15 minutes... I could have slit my wrists, it was that bad! Sorry, Have I said too much.?"
1,"ho hum: If you're looking for porn or something to see, this is NOT it. These are not real fights, but amateur boxing (most of the girls have never boxed before) with 3 rounds each. After the 1st 30 minutes it's a bore."
1,"Waste of time.: I bought this video while thinking to myself, ""hot chicks beating the crap out of each other, sweet"". Well, none of these things turned out to be the case. The chicks aren't hot, in fact one either used to be a man, or still is a man. The violence is limp to say the least. Imagine an episode of cops where neighbors at the trailer park are in a domestic disturbance. The problem is that the girls aren't athletes, nor do they seem to care much if they win. Stay away, this is just some dude with a camcorder attempting to get you to part with your money."
2,"High Quality Hot Beverage Holder: These cups are easy to clean and drink from. the color is excellent.A worthy addition to your home."
2,"Great story but a little tedious in places: My mother had read another Dorothy Canfield Fisher novel as a girl and loved it. When I found this, I bought it for us both. It's a very interesting story, but I find Ms. Fisher's style to be somewhat pedantic and tedious. Her syntax is of another age, and it makes reading the book rather time consuming. I like the characters and the plot, however, and am eager to see how things turn out for Sylvia and her family. I would recommend the book only to those who like old-fashioned stories and who know something of Ms. Fisher's educational philosophy. The casual reader may not have the patience to wade through it."
2,"Creative and Inspiring: I loved this book, but when I got ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"" I was surprised to find ""Making Journals by Hand"" is actually included in that text in full: word for word, page for page, project for project .Instead of buying ""Making Journals by Hand"" and ""Making Memory Boxes"", save some money and buy one book: ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"". This book combines all of the projects above and then some.All of these books have great projects and instructions."
2,"Way Cool Ideas!: A beautiful book. I love everything about it: crisp photography, nice paper, great ideas, an abundance of inspiring bon mots, lots of resources listed at the back of the book. After flipping through its pages, I wanted to jump off the sofa and begin journaling! But I didn't. I felt a little overwhelmed by the creative journal pages I saw. I just don't know where people get some of their amazing ideas. I wish my mind were half as fertile as those whose works are featured in the pages of ""Making Journals by Hand."" I will, however, continue enjoying the visual feast between its covers and hope for a divine intervention that will get me off the sofa and into the craft room to create a fabulous rememberance, just as the featured artists have done. If you like books, paper, art, rubber stamping, writing, color, cool ideas, and peeking into other people's journals, buy this book."
1,"Skimps on Content: While the journals in here were really beautiful, it doesn't look like the author put a lot of effort into explaining them. It only took me about an hour to read this book and, even with a few creative ideas(mostly from the pictures), the general content was sparse. Some of the shaded sections on the side looked like space filler (for example, one on ""themes"" describes a travel journal's purpose as ""chronicling your travels""...no way!). It bothers me when writers use pretty pictures to try and pull off the appearance of a quality book. Flip through this book in the library to get some good ideas, but don't expect thoughtful written advice."
1,"Doesn't live up to title: While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to ""make"" them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."
1,"journal making?: I bought this book wanting to learn how to make a journal. This book did not show the basics. It was a waste of money, the author seemed more interested in presenting cute ideas and making pretty pictures than teaching basics."
2,"Radiator replacement: The radiator cost half of what it cost at parts stores.So far no leaks except a rubber stopper they use was thin,cracked and leaked.I had a feeling it would so I carried a spare $1.00.I do recomend this product anyway.The shipping was prompt,with no hassles."
1,"Failed after 6 months: Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there."
1,"For collectors only!: This CD only contains 2 songs, both of which are available on Madonna's first album. Definately only for those who can't stand not having any given Madonna cd for their expansive collection."
1,"Not my type of book: I just couldn't get into this book. Right from the start, it seemed like the author was trying to hide something from the reader and that annoyed me. Also, it contained too many long descriptions. Not my type of book."
2,"EXCELENT PERFECT FABULOS SUPER: I loved this book! I read the first Egerton hall book, the Tower room when i was bored one day and i couldn't but then down untill i read this one. Bella is just me I love her and the ending is sooo Sweet BUY BORROW OR STEAL THIS BOOK,AND THE TOWER ROOM AND WATCHING THE ROSES AS THEY ARE MUST READ"
1,"Jerry Lewis' Worst Movie: I admit I gave up on this movie after about 50 minutes. But up to that point the whole ""comedy"" revolved around Dean Martin bullying and shouting at Jerry Lewis, for no obvious reason. I am a life-long Jerry Lewis fan, I adore many of his movies, but not this one. It is pointless tripe. I never thought I'd give up on a Jerry Lewis movie, without watching it all the way through. But after 50 minutes, I felt like shouting back at Dean Martin for his odious carry on in this film. Whoever wrote the script doesn't know the first thing about humour. What a tedious movie!!!!"
2,"I love it!: I love this movie!To see Jerry in a dress is always funny.Skinny and hairy!What a riot!!!He's a very handsome man,but he makes a funny looking laaaaaadddddyyyyyy!!!It's worth watching."
1,"At War With the Army rating: I disliked this DVD because close to the end of the movie it was all defected or scratched up and I did not get to see the end of the movie. I mean it was Jerry Lewis, so I know there were some good laughs at the end. So disappointed."
1,"Same old junky print!: Was hoping that this would be an upgrade to the many versions I have bought over the years. Sadly it is not. It is taken from the same horrible print. Decent movie, but baaaaad quality. Let the buyer beware! This is the item I bought. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00005YVX9/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
2,"I love the young Jerry.: Jerry has such a humble approach in his character it is very easy to sink in. There is never a dull moment when he comes onto screen. I love his B&W's."
2,"old time magic: this is a old movie that shows how they did it years ago you can get lost in it and enjoy it verry funny a must see"
1,"Good Times Video...Skip it: What Dean & Jerry fan does not know of this movie?My intention is to save those of us collectors time and money.The Good Times Video version appears to have been recorded from a vhs - that was itself recorded from another vhs without Time Base Correction - about 10 times.It's presented as Academy Standard 1.37:1 (original film aspect)Yep - that bad. Perhaps it was better than nothing, but now that something has hit the market, do yourself a favor, skip this version."
1,"Dean and Jerry on a Low Budget: The slow-paced ""At War with the Army"" (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage. Some nice moments (the ""Going My Way"" parody remains priceless), but not enough to justify the endless 93-minute length. One of the comedy duo's weakest efforts."
1,"Hmmmmmm...: I guess I didn't find this CD memorable, as I couldn't even remember what it sounded like. There were no particular pieces that jumped out at me and cried ""Dance to me."" Overall I was not that impressed."
1,"Complete piece of junk: Had one of these when I was a kid, it was fun so I bought one as a gift for my son. The rocke didn't mate correctly with the pump but we tried gamely to hold it in place and pumped it a few times, at which point the valve on the pump separated from the body. There was virtually no force being applied to this part of the pump, it was a press fit piece that couldn't possibly withstood any real pressure from the pump. It was a total joke, this is not a complicated piece of equipment, it was never built to do anything other than to dupe the consumer."
1,"JUNK! (says China on product): When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. After three pumps the check valve that holds the air in the rocket failed. You would push the pump in and all the air would get sucked out of the rocket when you pulled the pump back out. Then the mounting nipple snapped off when releasing the rocket from the clamp. Never worked once! Would like to find one that works, but they all look the same."
1,"don't waste your money: I had several of these as a kid and never had a problem. This one was defective out of the box! When i tried to put the rocket on the pump and lock it in place the air pump nipple snapped off and rendered the toy useless. After further inspection i found that the rocket itself was the cause. The plastic ring at the base that attaches to the pump was deformed and would not mount on the pump properly, when i slid the pump lock over the mount it started to bind and snapped the nipple off.I packaged it up and returned it.I may try some of the other models to see how they stack up."
1,"Can't get it to work: I used to love these rockets back in the day when I was a kid, so I got one for my 11-year old son. When it arrived, it looked like the ones I had as a kid, but was obviously of cheaper quality. Then again, it cost only a few bucks. Problem is, when I put the water in and then snap close the end of the pump, all the water leaks out! This happens whether the rocket is pointed up or down. The rocket is totally useless and we had to throw it away. Too bad, those rockets sure were fun a long time ago..."
1,"Broke immediately: It's hard to write a full 20 words on a toy that broke on the very first use leaving me with a cheap piece of plastic and a crying five year old."
1,"disappointed: Don't Waste your money the pump to pressurize the rocket broke after first and only use. Very disappointed bought this for my brothers children because he used to have one as a kid and he loved it so I bought this one and it broke on the first try."
1,"Memory Lane??: I bought 2 of these hoping to show my kids one of the toys I had growing up. Wow, these are straight CRAP. Why would someone produce a product that SUCKS this much?!! The clip that holds the rocket to the pump doesn't hold the rocket on. The O-ring is a dried, hard, brittle piece that doesn't seal. Then, when you get past ALL that crappy-ness, the pump shaft will either pull completely out, bend like a pretzel while pumping, or leak water into the pump itself! I got three launches out of 2 of these. I was more disappointed than the kids were. Boooooo!"
1,"Ron: Not as pictured. Doesn't seal well for the launch and so it is pretty much worthless. I had the one pictured when I was a kid and was pretty excited to order and now left with disappointment. Order what you see and you may get something else and cheaply made. Maybe should have bought this back in 2006 when it got better reviews. Amazon, please take this off your site!! It indeed is less than a quality product and your company is deceiving those who buy."
1,"Completely worthless: I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves rockets and I thought she would enjoy it. The pump is total junk and could not even pump enough pressure for a single flight before it broke. I spent an hour trying to fix it and the highest I've gotten the rocket to launch is a couple feet! This resulted in my daughter crying and the rocket getting thrown away. Do not buy this one!"
1,"Old School Rocket: Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted."
1,"Junk: Wanting to share my water rocket memories with my kids, I decided to try this rocket out in spite of all the bad reviews. I agree, it is junk. While the whole thing is cheaply constructed, the biggest problem I see is with the pump. The valving is so defective it simply will not pressurize the rocket. Even though I was very gentle with the pump, it came apart after only a couple pumps and the rocket never flew. I'd love to find a good one of these but this one is not."
1,"This toy is JUNK!: I ordered two of these for my kids. The pump for the rocket is made so you have to hold it while pumping but there is no good way to hold it securely while pumping. There is a trigger to lock in the rocket while pumping but the trigger is in the way of holding the pump and is unsafe because a simple bump makes the rocket launch accidentally. The piston in the pump is so cheap that it bends when you push it in. The end cap on the pump chamber is not properly secured to the pump. I tried the pumps that came with both rockets. The rocket's highest flight was about 10 feet becuase the pumps were so lame."
2,"Great Video on Holistic Medicine: My husband is an ND and an African Traditional Healer so I bought him this video for his birthday. He enjoyed it, for me it was a little long and mundane I thought it was more on spirituality. Yet and still, the birthday man was very happy. Anyone in the healing or medical field will enjoy the DVD. It does talk scientifically about how and why the herbs work. I learned new ideas about Tibetan Healing Techniques that are similar to African Traditional Healing. That was helpful for me because I do all the writing for his company and it gave me a new perspective.In conclusion if your interest is in the field this video is helpful."
2,"Good showing of Tibetian medicine: My fault that I did not know that this was in tibitian and had subtitles but the content is good and interesting to see in actual clinics and business in Tibet."
1,"not what I thought it should be: I missed a lot of the subcaptions but I think I may have understood the meaning of the file. May like it more in english."
1,"Don't bother.: Boring. What was I expecting? Something that would give me insight into my own abilities to heal self and others. This didn't do it. Especially since it wasn't in English."
2,"Provides excellent knowledge about Tibetan Medicine: ITem was shipped new and arrived in excellent condition. DVD provides a beginning knowledge about the almost lost art regarding Tibetan Medicine. As indicated in the DVD, there are very few doctors that still retain this knowledge and practice. Excellent overview but it is all in subtitles and obtaining any of the medicines/herbs seems as though it would be difficult. They take a wholistic approach and specialize the medicines for the person. You would need to go to India to get a diagnosis regarding your condition. Too bad it is not closer."
2,"Think for your self!: ""If people let government decide what foods they eat and what medicines they take, their bodies will soon be in as sorry a state as are the souls of those who live under tyranny.""- Thomas Jefferson"
2,"THE KNOWLEDGE OF HEALING: A GOOD VIDEO BUT IT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION THAT I COULD USE WITH MY CLIENTS.A HELPFUL OVERVIEW OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE"
2,"Enlightening: Must have movie,Must have, inspiring, enlightening, eye opening, good, heart felt enlightening, must have in your own library, movie to keep and give"
2,"Perfect for post-surgery footwear: I recently had surgery on my ankle after breaking it pretty badly & needed to find socks to wear under my brace (aircast boot). My doc said I could just wear my own socks, but my own socks are way too tight to comfortably wear with my swollen foot & ankle. I found these & they're perfect to comfortably fit without putting any pressure on my incredibly sensitive foot. The only con would be the price - not sure why it's so expensive to make what are basically incredibly lightweight mesh socks (they do have extra padding on the feet, but they're still very light/thin socks). But ultimately, they're worth the price for me (so much so I'm buying a second pair)."
1,"Not great: I guess these would be good if you had foot surgery and wanted to place something lose and protective over bandaging, but not for under a boot cast. I was under the impression these would be tall enough to almost reach my knee. They only go about 4"" above the ankle. Very wimpy, probably wouldn't hold up to too many washes."
2,"I've never felt better!: Bringing Yoga to the office is the object of this neat, compact workbook, Desktop Yoga. If you've got five minutes in your day to devote to Lusk's simple and effective exercises, your work day will seem like less of a burden. Great for relieving stress! A must-have!"
2,"This is a God-send: This is a wonderful resource that helps me get through every day at work. My headaches and neckaches are better since I started using the yoga stretches and breathing techniques. It has taught me how to powernap to revive me from feeling exhausted, and has given me lots of tips on how to cope with change, handle stress, and enjoy life more. A lot of helpful information is packed into the useful book. Thank you very much."
2,"Excellent book, especially for working people: Provides many yoga-based stretching exercises that are great for people who spend a lot of time working at a desk or some other sort of sedentary occupation."
1,"NOT WORTH THE MONEY: This is totally different from the ""classic albums"" series of DVDs that have come out which I love. This is a ""classic album under review"" which basically has a bunch of fat old guys talking about how great AC/DC is. The clincher for me was the fact that they had an AC/DC tribute band on to play the guitar riffs from this album. A TRIBUTE BAND?!?!? I'm sure that was great fun for those guys to do, but I think the people watching would rather see the actual band playing the songs. This DVD went on WAY too long and only had little snippets of the band playing live. Way too much filler for me and not what I thought this DVD was going to be. I do not recommend it."
1,"Come on.............: We know Back in Black was one of the best albums in history...do we really need some ""experts"" to tell us this ??I'm a big AC/DC fan I would not buy this...."
1,"Unbeliavable....: So they release a DVD to say how good ""Back in Black"" is (as if we needed to be remembered of that...) and they put a photo at the front cover with SIMON WRIGHT in the line-up, instead of Phil Rudd! Wright joined the band THREE YEARS after the recording of ""Back in Black"".This fact alone is a very good omen of the real intentions of this product: to make easy and fast money and offering nothing new about this classic rock album. Useless."
2,"cheaper on overstock: I have bought sensus memory foam pads for every bed I have had to sleep on in the last few years, and I love them. [...] My first Sensus mattress topper was a 4 inch version from a bedding website and that did cost me over 400 and I still felt that it was worth it, but i would have given up the inch and just gotten the 3 inch version on overstock if I knew it would cost less than half that. The shipping costs on overstock are almost nonexistant as well. Maybe the person who said it wore out after 5 years wouldn't be so upset if he/she only paid 170. That would work out to only $34/year."
1,"Manufacturer does not honor their warranty: It was a great mattress topper while it lasted. However, in less than five years of ownership I noticed the topper lost a considerable amount of firmness. It became too soft to sleep on except for the edges and I found myself waking up less refreshed. It's like trying to sleep on a 'V' shaped mattress.I contacted the manufacturer, Foamex, twice via email but they never responded. Finally I called and was told they won't service the mattress; redirecting me back to the seller who has since gone out of business. I have no experience with this seller, however I would suggest anyone considering purchasing a Sensus brand viscoelastic mattress or topper be aware that you will likely have problems before the ten-year warranty has expired. Plus, even if you find a seller who doesn't turn a warranty claim into a hassle, you will find they are rather expensive to repackage and ship. I will not purchase another Sensus or Reflex brand product."
2,"This is not a review.: This is not a review, it's a rave. This is not some piece of self-conscious, tricked out, contempo ironic (the knowing wink in the voice), cooler than thou vocabulary popcorn or breathy lil grrl prom panic whine. This is real music. The full range of expression. It will move you. Watch out."
2,"KING OF SLEEZE OF THE 70'S: If you enjoy bad scripts, bad actors poor film quality that was the early 70's, this is right up your alley."
1,"Enough with the Adult Conspiracy!: The Xanth series is what got me reading sci-fi and fantasy novels. Its a shame this series has turned into unreadable mush.Zombie Lover was the last book I've bought in this series and I don't think I'll continue with it. I can't take in anymore stories of adolescents thinking about who they want or don't want to have sex with."
2,"book: received used book purchase 1 day early, very happy about that. book was in great shape. book purchased for gift and recipient was very happy with it."
2,"Enjoyable novel: This was the first Xanth novel I ever read, but it was easy enough to get into. I wasn't too confused by reference to other Xanth novels as they were minimal and were not much focused on. Some of the jokes were rather funny, and the plot had enough humorous twists in it (and a couple of cool surprises!) to keep me well-entertained. It was a rather enjoyable book, though I definitely like Incarnations of Immortality better. overall 3.5/5 stars."
2,"Another Excellent Achievment: This book was another wonderful addition to the Xanth series. As with all of the Xanth books, it was a book that I could not stop reading. The book was interesting from beginning to end. To experience yet another adventure with the well known characters was a real treat, and gets better with each book."
1,"Zombie Lover or Sex,Sex,Sex: This is the worst of the Xanth novel, that I have read. I was greatly disappointed in the emphasis on sex. This book seemed to be written for the politically correct, morally lost society member. Piers Anthony did his Xanth fan's a disservce with this novel. Also take note of the cover picture, a small peite ""white girl"" and a zombie, well part of that is in the story. Why was the cover misleading, possibly to sell this trashy novel. Save your money, don't buy this book."
2,"smelly pens: My kids love these pens. They last and last.I had a set from the late 1970's and I could still color with them.This was our 2nd set for the kids and deffinately will purchase again."
2,"Compact and Convenient: Works great and compact and convenient. The detachable lanyard is nice for when I don't want to carry my pack with me. I don't see myself using the white and black cards too often, but they're nice to have. The cards are of a nice quality, thick enough to not bend accidentally when in the camera bag."
2,"Great color, small size: I take photos of antique prints for sale in a controlled condition (photo lights, etc), making correct color of utmost importance. The card is small to set the white balance on my camera, but works wonderfully with Adobe Lightroom to set the custom white balance. I am new to photography, but have found that this combination is working well for me."
1,"An Inferior Copy of a Great Product: I think this is my first review in the years I've been on Amazon, but for once I feel that I need to speak out on a bad product.I bought both the DGK and theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2""x3.5"")and I have to say that the WhiBal just feels better and feels that it will last a lot longer(the DGK cards are only about the third of the thickness of a WhiBal). However the Digital Grey Kard has one thing going for it, it has a superior laynard.I would recommend spending a few bucks more and get theWhiBal White Balance Reference Card - Pocket Kit (2""x3.5"")instead."
2,"Works Great-short comings yes but--: As a retired negative wedding photographer, I want spot-on results. But with the digital age I had trouble getting exposure/white balance correct. Yes, the processor could correct for my ""slight"" errors. I did not appreciate how important white balance was, nor that it can change as easy as exposure. After a couple of tests w/this card. I was amazed at the skin tones I got. I used a drug store type quality (Costco) for convenience & speed and got great exposures! Just think what a higher quality firm (i.e. Dale Labs) can do with my files!Photo correction programs: Just use the ""eye-dropper"" tool; get color corrections- presto!Short comings: The cards could be larger! The instructions could be more detailed- The makers of this product could benefit from comments here!"
2,"Great Movie: Bought this item for my son and he loves it!!! I ordered it for Christmas and was a little worried it wouldn't make it to my house in time, but to my surprise it arrived very quickly!!"
1,"dissapointment: If you're getting this DVD for the trains like i was don't bother unless you're looking for 2 Thomas trains. You're not going to get Donald like the picture shows."
1,"Earland below average: This 1991 Muse Records CD (out of print)is among Earlands weakest B-3 performances recorded. Standard tunes like ""Unforgetable"" and ""Europe"" (yes, the Santana hit) is arranged and played like elevator music and goes nowhere...But there are moments where Earland shines and cook's predictable with his combo like on ""Sheila"" and ""Kicker"", but thats all. Even Earland's sidemen like Eric Alexander on tenorsax does not lift the overall performance quality. Thia is not capured misic, this manufactured music. For Earland collectors - put this CD in your shelf and start looking for Earlands recordings on Prestige, Milestone and Savant/HighNote"
2,"Great Fun Album: They are at a party playing mostly acoustic guitars and bongo drums. They sing some Beatles tunes as well as their own. They have allot of fun on this and it's an unusual album.It says instrumental but they do sing and they sing acapella's too that's where the other tracks are. There are 2 different albums and one does have 20+ tracks"
2,"good for accompanying: I bought this CD originally when I was in junior high, to accompany me while I practiced my saxophone (I preferred to practice to Beach Boys music over the school fight song). Anyway, it's also good for karaoke. However, be careful listening to the previous reviewer, who either can't count or has a different CD. There are 15 tracks on the CD, which last I checked is *not* over 20."
2,"Dysfunctional Funeral: While many families don't get along for one reason or another... Sometimes it takes a miracle to make people look at their own lives a bit closer... in this film.. mainly a comedy with some twist... you might relate to dealing with a whole family coming together for a mothers funeral.You may check out the trailer here as long as Youtube has it available[...]"
1,"Chinese American Film at its worst: This is the worst film I have ever seen made by and about Chinese Americans. It may be of interest to people of mixed Asian ancestry since most of the cast is of mixed race. The premise may have been taken from an episode of ... Little House on the Prairie(!) wherein Charles helps a woman fake her own funeral to bring her ""distant"" kids home to see her."
1,"BIG THUMBS DOWN: I rented this thinking it would be an interesting subject on American-Chinese tradition here in the U.S. But I was wrong, it was a total disappointment. The story and its sub-plots are too contrived. The script is very formulaic; even adding a twist at the ending was typical and intentional - just so for audiences who likes a twist in their movies. Any viewer wouldn't get involved watching this film. Basically this is about a group Chinese-American siblings who has hang-ups with themselves and among each others. Set in the affluent neighborhood of San Francisco, it portrays an embarrassingly rich family by showing the amenities of the matriarch's sprawling extravagant house. Tennis, a dip in the pool, jacuzzi anyone? Jeez! I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,"Shake Shake Shake: Great Gift Great Value - I had to get one for myself. The glasses are over sized and the shaker stirs up a great batch of dry Martini's. I love the retro glass look and the shaker has a seal to prevent leaking while shaking your favorite drink."
2,"good martini set: glasses are awesome. They look great and they are larger than your average martini glasses. All my friends loved the glasses when I had a martini party.The shaker looks great, but alas, it leaks all over your hands when shaken, despite having a seal. So be careful!!But for this price, it's still a great buy."
1,"Aesthetically pleasing but not functional: While I like the looks of this set a lot, with its retro feel, I find the shaker to be in need of a design overhaul. Every time this is used (and it's been used by several people so I don't think it's a user problem) it spills while pouring! This has been very frustrating to lose good top shelf vodka because of poor design. I had to go out and purchase another shaker because of this problem so I would not recommend this set."
2,"Very Nice: I got a similar set (3-pc with shaker and 2 glasses). I agree with the other reviews about the shaker, it leaks a little bit. I suggest getting another shaker, but keeping this one around as a back-up OR wrapping a small towel around the leaky seam. I like the texture of the shaker and glasses. It's classy and not so overdone that it's tacky."
1,"Beware: The set is cute to look at, but as far as actually using, it is terrible. The glasses are fine, but the shaker is so hard to use, I actually took a chunk out of my finger trying to get it open to refill it! I've never used it again."
1,"A booklet- not a textbook!: At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. As basic instruction for those 10 and under, it is probably okay. For anyone who even doodles while talking on the phone- forget it!"
2,"art book: I was happy with the book on how to draw but it is for an older child. I'm sure our granddaughter will be able to do the drawing, just not the reading. We will need to help her."
1,"Not for Metal!: Received this in great time- I have no problem with the seller:-)BUT! The inside of the case lists all types of materials this can cut including metals, which is what I got it for.One punch through soft 26ga copper sheet and the edges of the punch bent & in some areas, flaked off. The second disk I cut did it in completely. I had to file all of the edges and it probably would have been easier to cut the sheet with shears.So, not for metals.However, I can see it would be great for leather, paper & plastics.To me it was worth the money spent on the chance that it would actually cut metal disks."
1,"Not good!: I purchases this set for simple craft projects...mainly to cut card stock and cardboard. I tried hammering the punches with my 12 oz. hammer and it didn't go through the card stock. Got my husbands big beefy hammer...it still will not punch through thin card stock. I am very disappointed in this product. Glad I didn't pay a lot...complete waste of $"
2,"Awesome!: Just what I needed. Worked like a charm. Loved the various sizes. I suggest using an x-acto cutting mat underneath the leather. It'll get destroyed but it gives you a nice clean cut."
1,"BEWARE OF SERIOUS SAFETY CONCERN!: I really dont want to give this product a bad rating as it is just a simple tool that does what its supposed to. But it has a serious safety flaw/problem!!:The kit came with no instructions, so I was figuring out how it worked, and as I was turning the screw on the side of the barrel, the sharp pointed 2 inch pin needle inside the barrel shot out like a projectile dart. It was spring loaded and the screw is what held it in.Luckily it wasnt aimed at myself or anyone, because it could have caused serious injury. After the pin shot out I was left feeling very disturbed that this tool could have taken out my eye out.So, I feel compelled to warn and advise others who might be buying this tool set."
1,"West Coast Avant Garde: Listen to the sound bite before you buy. I didn't, but I should have. This is way to modern for me, I like cool west coast jazz, but this is sort of Ornette Coleman meets Karlheinz Stockhausen--very modern in tone. If that is your bag, the album is for you, otherwise pass this one by."
2,"Listen Compute Rock Home: I received this record as a gift and have listened to it over and over with my friends at school. Many of the items are great for kids, but my friends and I love the psychedelic music and sound effects. My current favorite is ""Army Ants in Your Pants""...very imaginative!"
1,"wonder woman costume: This was purchased for my daughters halloween costume. BEWARE! Very cheap material! The sizes are different from what it reads online, and the pieces of the costume are different sizes. For example: the skirt is waaaay too small but the pullover ""boots"" fit just fine. As all the other reviews claim, the outfits ""color/graphics"" peeled off because it was stuck to the plastic package. I do not recommend this unless they are only using it for dress up."
2,"pretty good: Got this through Amazon for my daughter's superhero party. She could hardly wait to put it on. The quality is OK - some parts (like the skirt) have gotten stuck together and the color has come off a bit. For a costume though, it'll serve a good purpose, and provide hours of fun. The boots a really high. My daughter is tall for her age, but the boots go all the way up (and even under) the skirt. Just FYI."
2,"Engulfing , tremendous makes you feel like you were there: This book is totally engulfing from page one .It puts thereader inside the fall of a great empire . It really makesyou feel as if though you were there . And it also gives youso much knowledge , that you could talk about it as if thoughwere there . A definite must read for anyone interested inhistory , and for those who are not also . Because it is agreatly written story about the most important event in thiscentury"
1,"Printing is WAY too small!: Book is over 600 pages and the print is so small it was difficult for me to try to read so I returned it. Perhaps if it ever comes out on Kindle I would try again."
1,"Lenin's Tomb : The Last Days of the Soviet Empire: this book should be a text book for those studying soviet history. the author assumes that the reader is very well informed--certainly better informed that i am. he drops names that are mostly meaningless and impossible to put into context! his vocabulary is beyond the college level. do you know the word ""ramify""? i didn't.but the positive side is that remnick has done remarkable research. he has put himself into situations that have put him at risk. his descriptions are graphic and frightening. he is courageous.i read the first half, but couldn't continue. it is part of my too hard file."
2,"Fascinating tour of the times leading up to and after the fall of the Soviet Union: This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union, providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before, during and after the Gorbachev era. It maps the mindset and events during this dramatic change. It is told with a direct, personal style that I found gripping, and that gives a very good sense of the societal changes and impacts. I highly recommend it."
1,"Huge & Unreliable: I don't know if i got a faulty binder,or its just bad quality because it's a big binder, but the moment i opened it and put some paper in, and then closed it, I noticed that the ring was broken, it wont shut all the way tightly and so EVERY SINGLE TIME that I try to take anything out or move papers it opens and its just a big mess. I had to get a new one because i couldn't even use it, and it's frustrating because im in school and NEED a binder that will just WORK !"
1,"Broke within the first week: I bought this binder for my son who started middle school. Withing the first week, one set of rings did not close properly and now my son has to carefully go through his notebook so the papers don't fall out. Everything gets stuck at the point where the rings don't completely close. Poorly made product."
2,"This thing is huge: I got this for my 800+ page unbound textbook, and it could easily hold at least 300 pages more. The only problem with it is, because of the size, you cannot put it into a backpack with room for anything else. I ended up having to get a smaller 2-inch binder and put a few chapters at a time in it for easier transportation."
2,"Great Find: After long search for translation of Montale's poems, this bilingual edition was perfect. Book was in perfect condition and arrived at exactly the announced date."
1,"very bad movie/DVD quality: I've been studying South Asia so I thought I'd watch some movies by people in the region. The movies arrived quickly but the sound quality is terrible and the DVDs themselves skip and get stuck on my computer, my parents' DVD player, and every other DVD player you put them on. The movies themselves have great storylines and music, but the DVDs are really poor quality."
1,"Probably the Worst Movie I've Ever Seen: I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"
1,"Come on is this Real??: You figure zombie movies have been out for at least 20 years and to this date we still can't produce a low budget zombie movie with better actors. The dialogue was good the presentation sucked. it was like they were reading the dialogue instead of experiencing it. The plot was good as well. This movie had all the elements of a well made zombie flick but no one was chomped only the token Lesbian Black chick. Good try but I wanted more."
1,"Uhhh.: I can not be certain but I don't think the other reviewers and I saw the same movie. Acting was terrible video was terrible plot was terrible. Good try I guess."
2,"More Z's Please!: This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too."
1,"not very good: i don't remember this movie, so i know it was bad. i probably did not watch the whole thing. bad production, bad acting"
1,"This was a waste of time.: Let's keep this simple: promising plot ruined by -Bad acting.Poor and often ignorant dialogue (scripting).Inconsistent plot elements (slow walking zombies, then fast ones, then back to slow).An inhabited island overrun by zombies, yet not a SINGLE boat was available anywhere.Piss poor directing.What else is there left to say?"
1,"The Worst!: I'm not sure what zombie movies the other reviewers have watched but I find it hard to believe they actually liked this one. I feel like I was tricked into paying for this based on the reviews. The acting sucks. The set design sucks. The effects suck. What I'm trying to say is that this movie sucks."
1,"dont waste your time or money.: lower then low budget with horrible dialogue and acting. Two six year olds could have done better with a couple of kindergarten actors"
1,"The DVD has missing segments!: In the past, our family has purchased three videos from this series and LOVED THEM! This DVD advertised SIX segments on its cover and on Amazon's advertising, but only three interrupted segments were on the disc we received. In the end, the contexts for the stories are missing and so is one title of each segment pair intended to support the educational message. Has anyone else had this problem or do we have defective discs? We are returning ours to Amazon ASAP. and hope to get corrected discs."
2,"The belt was not included: When I finally gave the costumes to the kids I noticed that the one custome of Batgirl was not complete. The belt was missing."
2,"My 7 year old daughter loved being batgirl...: The costume was perfect for my daughter and the best part is the costume came with every thing you need to be a very adorable batgirl. The quality was good as well."
1,"Poor quailty: Item sizing was not consistent. Had to make modifications just to wear it and make it fit. Cheap and torn before could even use it."
2,"My daughter liked it: While I am not a big fan of this costume, my four year old liked it and that's all that matters. She wore it almost every day before Halloween and she felt so proud to say to others she was going to be a super hero for Halloween. She definitely has enjoyed it, the price was great so I am happy with this purchase."
1,"ok: This costume is very flimsy, but the bright pink color is great. The only problem we had was the elastic on the mask was too short to fit my daughter's head. So I cut it off and used glue dots to glue the mask onto a pair of sunglasses that I pushed the lenses out of. Perfect fit and much easier to wear!"
1,"not too durable.: This was great as a Halloween Costume. however, after my daughter tried it on, one of the straps on the leg covers broke and the mask was too tight. Good for a one time use. My daughter enjoyed it."
2,"Too bad it did not bring the Mask: My 4-year old girl loved the costume but unfortunately it did not include the mask. I inquired the seller and they confirmed there was a confusion : the description of the Costume did not include a mask , I replied even I did not notice it in the description, the picture showed the girl with the mask and there was no clarification about it. I think they should have made a clarification, it seems to me it is false publicity. It is good to know they have updated the picture."
2,"Batgirl was a Christmas hit!: My 3 year-old niece loves to dress up, so we got her this costume for Christmas. She loved it and spent the rest of Christmas vacation wearing it."
1,"Missing main dress, belt and cloak!!!: I received the package with missing main dress, belt and cloak (I received only the mask, gauntlets and shoes cover)I'm an oversea customer and it will be very costly for me to return this item as already I paid the shipment fees to get this item.I sent them an e-mail on 1/11/2013 requesting to send me the missing items , BUT, they didn't respond till now!!!"
2,"Good for the price: My daughter loved the styling, loves being a ""super hero."" We got this on discount on the offseason, so it was an extremely good buy."
1,"Cape is very small/ fabric is very thin: The material is thin thin thin which I expected from this kind of costume. The mask didn't really hold up for one halloween party and one night of trick or treating. The worst part was that the cape in the picture is big enough for the girl to hold with both hands but in reality it isn't that big at all. Also the velcro that holds the cape on didn't even hold up on Halloween night. Disappointing"
2,"Fabulous: The costume came fast and fit awesome. My only complaint was with the shoe coverings. They broke easily and would not stay on my daughters shoes so we ended up not using them."
1,"Expect what you pay for: The price was cheap and so was a majority of the craftsmanship. Also, the belt was not in the package and we bought it new."
1,"Wouldnt buy it again!: I bought two of these bat girl costumes for my two daughters. The masks started falling apart after the first time wearing them. The material was so cheap it literally fell apart!!! I was SO disappointed! By the time Halloween came I had completely redone the masks and stapled the silver belt back together.I have never rated anything before but I couldn't help myself, I want people to know what they are buying."
1,"Wouldn't recommend: The sizing of this costume was fairly accurate but it very cheaply made. After only a few wears, the mask and belt both broke. I wouldn't recommend this costume."
2,"Great Costume!: This is a fabulous costume! My daughter loves it and has had it on every day since it arrived last week. She even slept in it a couple of nights. The other reviews are correct in saying that it needs some mending. We had to reinforce the velcro on the mask and the elastic on the bottom of the boots. After a little stitching it is fine. We also sewed on a small piece of material to the back of the face mask so that it wouldn't stretch any further and tear. This was a fabulous idea. Do it! I only deducted one star for this because the rest of it is great. The material is a durable shiny pink. My daughter is a size 4 and wears a size 9 shoe and the small fits perfectly. If she were a 5 or older I would get the medium. Totally worth the money."
1,"Too small and stained: I ordered this for my average sized 8 year old. I purchased the medium (size 8-10) and it is way too small. It's too short, tight around the shoulders, the boot covers don't cover her foot and the mask won't go around her head (not even close and again she's 50%ile in both height & weight for her age). This size would be better for a 5 year old! And if that isn't bad enough, the cape has a dark (non-removable) stain on it! I'm hoping I can return it w/o paying for shipping considering this item is damaged."
1,"Bad thing: The fabric is very common, the finishes are really bad, the mask was broken the first time, the layer has no seams, the fabric also is leadership, not what I expected."
1,"poor: Was missing the belt for one thing was to small had to order another one just so she could use it they need to put the correct size on the item we ordered a 5-6 got ot and the item said fits size 4-5"
1,"No belt!!!: My costume was a small and didn't fit my 5 year old wayyyy to tight and it dd t come with the belt!!!"
2,"Awesome Costume: This is a great costume. All the extra pieces make it really great. This is one of our favorite costumes."
2,"cute costume: cute costume but make sure you get all the pieces im missing the belt and i already threw the packaging away and i didnt even notice the belt was missing :("
2,"She loves it: Pink Bat-girl is a hit at our house. She loves to dress up. Costume is a little flimsy but will last through the Halloween season and maybe some dress-up after. Skimpy and thin so plan on wearing something under it. (I wish we had bought a size larger) Don't be fooled by the cape it does not go over the shoulders, only behind the back. It is very cute and my 7 year old daughter loves it."
2,"like this on the best: I have purchased many bevel tools and I like this one because it goes further down into thehole and the shape feels better to my hand especially when working out a lot of thumb holesused this product a lot and haven't had to sharpen it yet."
2,"Lush ""Masquerade"", enegetic Gayne &Spartacus: My title says it all. Love this CD. Khachaturian is a great, great Artist and he always thrills and touches you. You'll love this one."
2,"Umbra 24-inch tension rod: I am pleased with the rod as it fit the small shower enclosure. It did fall only once after I put it up, but I retightened it and it's remained in place ever since. Excellent value for the dollar"
2,"great!: I bought this for a narrow entry tiled shower. It was very hard to find a tension bar that would work for my 26"" shower opening - not to mention I wanted a nickel or chrome finish. The bar fits snugly, but is not as heavy as I had hoped. It hold a thin shower curtain very well, but would not hold up to a heavier curtain. Perfect for my use/"
1,"THIS IS NOT A SHOWER CURTAIN ROD: I searched Amazon for ""shower curtain rod, nickel"" and this product is returned in the results. From the image, it looks just like other shower curtain rods sold on Amazon; however, this rod is only about 1/2 inch in diameter and will not work as a shower curtain rod. Don't be fooled like I was."
1,"thin: The picture seems to show a somewhat robust rod, but what you get is a very thin (1/2"") rod. When exteneded to near its mazimum length it becomes very flimsy and will barely hold my small shower curtain without bowing in the middle. I would have expected a little better for the price and the intended use. But, it works and it's black."
1,"Item was nice color: This rod was too flimsy in my stall shower to stay up more than 10 minutes with a curtain. We put it up at least four times and it fell down. I returned it. Color was nice, it was extremely thin."
1,"Disappointing: The pieces that attach to the shower wall are very small. Because of this, the rod never stays in place!!"
1,"Not good for showers: Nice, item for the price, but not good for shower curtain use; not enough tension force. Best for light curtains in small windows."
2,"Nice Tension Rod: It might not be the strongest but so far it has done it's job very well. It looks very nice and I am pleased. Just make sure that you dont leave it loose or it will fall on your head. Overall a nice product for the price."
1,"Too Small for a Shower Curtain: This rod is way to small for use with a shower curtain. I have no idea why it even comes up in the search. It may work for a simple curtain, but I doubt it."
1,"Pretty, but not functional: This curtain rod looks nice, but can barely hold any weight. It will only work with sheers."
1,"Poor Quality: This item does not look like the photo. It is very thin (.5"" or so) and the round decorative end part is very small (about 1.5"" diameter). There is a piece of white plastic that shows at the end of the rod that is not in the photo. It does not look well made- I would have preferred one of the plain white ones that you can buy anywhere- they look heavy duty next to this one. I have had an Amazon account for 10 years or so, and I have never before returned an item. This will be my first time."
2,"Umbra tension rod: I am pleased with my Umbra tension rod. I needed a rod with no hardware, because my new house has concrete block walls and deep window wells. This tension rod fits the bill and is a very attractive too."
1,"Shower Curtain Rod Review: Umbra Coretto 24 to 36-Inch Decorative Tension Rod, BlackThe rod is really good looking. However, because it is so thin, the weight of my shower curtain keeps causing the rod to come loose. If I had any idea, I probably would not have bought the rod. However, my shower is at the wider end....so maybe a person would have better luck if their shower is closer to 24""."
2,"Julia Child at her absolute best!!!!: This is my absolute favorite cooking series on PBS. Julia Child in her own home kitchen, with some of the greatest chefs working today. Her warmth and quirky humor shines throughout, and she has a lovely rapport with many of the guests. She is genuinely enthusiastic about the baked goods, and her baker-guests are obviously thrilled to be cooking side-by-side with Julia. Truly entertaining, even if you never make any of the recipes yourself! I only wish that they would make a box-set of the entire series!!"
1,"This DVD is not as represented in the description.: There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money."
1,"Sent damaged product: I received this DVD in a well packed box with another item. The other item was in perfect condition. However, this DVD's case was broken in several (at least 4) places. As I said, the box was well packed and insulated. The DVD had obviously been sent in the damaged state it was received in. Most disturbing is the fact that the damage to the DVD case was so OBVIOUS. Pieces are broken off inside the celephane wrapping that you can see and, when you pick it up, you cannot miss feeling them.The DVD itself skips in several places.Unacceptable and unethical behavior on the part of the sender. They had to have known they were sending me a severely damaged DVD case. It had to have been damaged at the time they packed it in the box.As a result, I was not able to give it as a gift as planned."
2,"A National Treasure: Julia Child was just the best! The entire food world, as we now know it, owe it all to her. Watching this as well as any other of her shows, particularly her first shows, are exciting, enlightening, educational! She is missed & will always be the best!!!"
1,"Shoddy Disks: The shows (and Julia) are great. 5 stars for them but the disk was defective from the manufacturer and would not play segment 2 (Decorative Loaves). First disk would freeze up and shut down the entire disk (as if stop button were pressed). Exchanged it and had the same problem with the second one. These shows deserve a much better presentation than this manufacturer was willing to give it. Great show, but lousy DVD mastering job."
1,"Longevity: I was initially impressed with the company and the product. The company ended up to be local which was a plus. The product didn't last a year and I purchased two of them. Both failed inside of a year."
2,"One of the best albums I've heard in years: This is a front to back cd which is a rarity. Kershaw puts together intelligent, thought-provoking lyrics with layered music that always has a lot going on.His creativity in terms of sounds that he comes up with is incredible. One can hear a little radiohead influence on this album.His transition from 80's alterna-pop to his now contemporary 90's acoustic-based sound seems so natural and is actually an improvement on his earlier stuff. I can't wait to hear what he comes up with next."
2,"Nik in the 2000's: I remember him in the 80's. I found some new tracks of his on youtube. Those tracks grew on me and I bought the CD. It's true, just about every song is great.Slower pace and slightly more acoustic than his 80's work. The songs are more from his heart, which is where every good song comes from.It's that type of album."
2,"At LEAST 15 minutes of listening pleasure!: This is what I listen to when I'm in my Adult Contemporary mood. (Well it's Kershaw more often than it is Springsteen) I've heard of all Nik's old 80's albums, and this really makes them sound bad. I mean, of course, songs such as ""The Riddle"" and ""Wouldn't It Be Good"" are better than anything on earth, but this new material is consistently impressive.""Billy"" is instantly likeable, while songs like ""Shine On"" and ""Made in Heaven"" are the slower favourites. ""God Bless"" is the only stinker, while every other song entertains us with cool guitars and songs that really grow on you over time.I guess all I'm trying, to say, it's worth the wait when an artist perfects their art instead of churning out rubbish twice a year."
2,"Handy Device: Very compact, well made, helps me level the camera when I set it on sloped surfaces and it stays in place due to the rubber feet. For the price and size it's a great alternative."
2,"The Best Pocket Tripod: This Sony VCT-TK1 is by far the best pocket tripod for instant use. I take it out of my pocket, screw on my camcorder, and it is ready to instantly take videos or self pictures.(Incidently, I have a wide variety of other different pocket-type tripods with three small legs and adjustable ball pan and tilt, but I do not use them.)"
2,"Good, simple...but limited Korean food: This is a good VEGETARIAN cookbook for those who want to cook meatless Korean food, but in my opinion, it is missing many delicious and meatless Korean dishes. The receipes are simple and easy (and they offer substitutes for certain Korean foods that might be hard to buy in the US.) Overall, good stuff, but you might want to also get a general Korean cookbook for more variety. You can always leave out the meat..."
1,"Fasion, Fops, Faux Pas: I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be ""Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion"", only recently published."
1,"Dreadful: 3/4 of this book is where to shop, with locations noted in Chicago, Houston, Florence, Milan, NYC, Vienna, etc (but not Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong). The rest is spoiled by a pompous, overbearing style that makes it unreadable."
2,"Style knowledge by Alan: This book is an excellent source of knowledge and information. So much of the information is still relevant today and is timeless. The deep level of knowledge and in sight into the industry and business is a real feast for the novice.Would recommend this to any man that is interested in his clothing image. The value of representing your self to the best of your ability.Colt 45"
2,"An Essential Part of your Collection: This book should occupy a prominent place in your collection. Yes its ok to own more than one book on sartorial correctness. Take this book for its strenghts (i.e.,the correct way to buy fine clothes) and don't worry about its drawbacks. This is an excellent source for learning about the theory and practice of dressing like a proper man. Much has been made about the outdated addresses of some of the stores in the second half of the book. Well my response is..get over it. Fine mens stores change addresses, its a fact of life. The important thing is the name and description of the store. With that said, sit back and enjoy the text and pictures and take responsibility for being a well heeled gentleman...if you dare."
2,"Great, if limited: Flusser is the second best writer on clothes (Boyer is the best) and the most knowledgeable. This is a very good book, whose only shortcoming is a lack of information. The first sections are shorter than I would have liked them, and the subsequent sections, though fascinating reading, are of limited usefulness to anyone who is not a rich globetrotter.Still, there is a lot of great info in those shop descriptions, but you have to glean it all out. An index would have been welcome.All told: clothing is about taste, and Flusser's taste is the best in the world, bar none. He has more than earned his position as arbiter of men's dress."
1,"Overrated book: I bought this book a year ago, mainly because of its high ratings. But I was disappointed. I read it once and I found the style of writing outdated and the content not so useful: many addresses where you should buy things, but how useful is that? I don't live nearby these places, and I want to learn WHY you should buy certain things so that I can decide for myself what is good to buy and what not. Such info is given only very briefly."
1,"Terrible: What if you live outside of New York? This book isn't applicable for anyone outside ""The City."" Buy a book from John Bridges instead."
2,"FOR THOSE WHO LIKE ONLY THE BEST !: MR.FLUSSER IS A MAN OF STYLE AND CLASSICAL ELEGANCE...IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A BOOK WHICH WILL TAKE YOU INTO A JOURNEY AMONG THE BEST - AND MOST EXPENSIVE- BRANDS AND SHOPS OF MEN'SWEAR, DON'T HESITATE BUY IT !"
2,"Outdated sure, but still relevant: This book, published in 1996 and half of which is a directory of shops, was bound to be outdated months after publication much less ten years after, as it is now. Hence the four stars instead of five.Given that, the first part of the book is crammed with a precis or summary of Flusser's recommendations that he has used several hundred pages to expound in his other books ('Clothes And The Man', 'Dressing The Man') and makes the book worth the (used) book price.I do not understand others who warn against this book because they think it is not objective enough! This is a book written by Flusser so of course you will get his subjective view. Had it been written by a committee of tailors, well then, I would expect a more balanced view, but it is not. It is up to the intelligent reader to understand they are getting a product of one man's opinion and then proceed accordingly."
2,"thank you for paving the way for me: bryan wilson is da bomb! I am a singer myself and i know good talent when i hear it. and when he sang ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"", it blow me away! He is phenomenal and I love to hear him sing because he feels what he is singing about and what singing really is--the anointing you put into it, not the show so many people try to put on. I wish you much success in the future to come. Maybe I'll get to sing with you when I come out. May God forever bless you in your music ministry! Much love, Your sister in Christ, Connie"
2,"An Awesome Ministry: I enjoy your music so much and every last one of your songs touch my heart. As a teenager I consider you a positive appearance and influence to all the other young people that they can be used of God and that they can stay saved. Be Blessed and keep looking up because your help cometh from the Lord and if you acknowledge God in all you do he will direct your path and give you the desires of your heart. God Bless You, take care, and continue to let God use you!"
1,"sucks: I just received two of these guns today and they both broke after about two minutes of shooting, don't buy it!!!"
1,"Don't buy this gun!!!!!: I hate this gun. It barely shoots fifteen feet at about 50 feet per second. It looks and shoots cool, but it really sucks. I don't recomend it at all"
2,"Thank YOU Dr. Bernstein!: This book was a wellspring of information for me as a newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic. Getting off the cycle of being told to eat complex carbs, seeing my blood glucose spike from doing just what I was told, and getting medications increased again and again, I read what Dr. Bernstein said with interest. After trying his recommendations I can say with no reservations that this book may have saved my life! I highly recommend it to anyone who has pre-diabetes or diabetes and hope that the general medical community opens their eyes. After only one day of this diet my blood glucose readings were close to normal, and continue to stay there, with less medication. My energy levels are high and I have felt better than I have in a long long time. Kudos to you Dr. Bernstein, for daring to say the truth! I recommend both his books and also Dr. Atkins Diabetes Revolution to anyone who wants to learn about diabetes and diet."
1,"Sorry, not convincing at all: Well, as a vegetarian and resident of a country seeing exploding diabetic population ( India) I find this approach to diabetes unconvincing.ONE, the emphasis is on animal foods. This has three difficultiescultural prohibitionsbiological concentration of alien hormones, pesticides and antibioticsand last not least, the cost factor of such a diet.TWO there is compulsive testing of blood sugar levels.THREE it encourages dependency on the clinician.Where's the sense of freedom in all this?In my counselling sessions I use sprouted whole legumes, leafy vegetables, NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS, resistence exercises, meditation, family support. It all works fine."
2,"This book is packed with information on Diabetes!: Interesting and informative book! This book is helpful for all diabetics--even those who are very knowledgeable about diabetes. There's always something more to learn about this disease. The diet is very restrictive and challenging to follow. But, a person's health does win out ultimately."
2,"Dr. Bernstein is GREAT!!!: Dr. Bernstein is a type 1 diabetic and had just about every sympton possible. He figured out the ""diabetes code"" and clearly explains how to control your diabetes. His cure is exactly opposite to that of the medical establishment. He was educated as an engineer, then became a medical doctor late in life. His book is designed to educate and not to impress how smart he is. Buy it.David Smith"
2,"excellent diabetes guide: This book has solved the problems we had while trying to manage my son's diabetes.You can find all answers in diabetes management."
2,"The proof is in the... not pudding...: The proof of a book on health issues is in the results it gets you, and it's very hard to argue with the results I've gotten from following Dr. Bernstein's plan. Many others have reviewed this book more capably than I can, but let me just say that after a few months of following Dr. B's diet, I've lost 50 lbs., gotten normal blood sugars, and feel better than I've felt in years. Highly recommended!"
2,"A practical life-saving guide.: The book gives practical advice for those with diabetes. I've had type 2 diabetes for 13 years and when another ailment required me to use prednisone, I needed insulin. Dr. Bernstein's book taught me about the types of insulin and syringes. His book removed my apprehension about needles and possible low blood glucose. Like many pioneers in medicine, Dr. Bernstein's ideas were opposite to mainstream methods when his book was first introduced. However, his recommendation for a limited carbohydrate diet like that of the late Dr. Atkins, appears to be gaining acceptance. Control of diabetes is very much up to the patient. Dr. Bernstein's book puts life-saving knowledge in the hands of the patient. I have found it invaluable."
1,"Not Really for Diabetes II: This book is mostly for those with Diabetes one.This is his second book.His first book was a good one and full of useful info for both types of Diabetes.If you are a Diabetic type I then this book is for you.If you are a Diabetic II then buy his first book.I am a Diabetic II and this book was really a waste of my money."
1,"strait to the looney bin: i can't live without carbohidrates! if you want to lose your mind, follow this diet; the pills dr bernstein prescribes for people who are addicted to carbohidrates, my doctor will not prescribe, i know this because he recomended me the high carb low fat diet to loose weight."
1,"Misleading: Blood sugar is only part of the equation. Following this type of diet causes high acidic levels which causes illness. This diet is nothing new. My grandmother followed this kind of plan back in the late 40's because they thought ALL carbs were bad. Today we know that the brain needs glucose to function. Carbs + high fiber leaves lower net carbs. And diabetics need a balance---in fact all people need a balance of healthy whole foods and exercise and fresh air. One more thing; my grandmother died of a massive heart attack on this kind of plan. She was only in her 50's."
2,"Diabetes Solution: This book was amazing. I found it when I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes years ago. Dr. Bernstein has a somewhat radical idea that instead of letting blood sugar peak and then pull it back down with meds or insulin is dangerous long term. His idea of controlling and achieving normal blood sugar levels by controlling diet is very good. I have been able to control mine for a number of years, my A1C is 5.3, and excellent value. My doctor got this book after I explained the ideas contained and he agrees with the plan Dr. Bernstein promotes here."
2,"Required Reading: I regard Dr. Bernstein as the top authority for Diabetes. This book will give a diabetic all the information required to completely understand his/her condition. I do not have the discipline to follow his recommended diet...however, with the understanding of Carbs, I can with diligence control blood sugars. I give more credence to the Glycemic Index than Dr. Bernstein...seems to work for me. I do not hesitate to recommend this book to all diabetics and partners of diabetics!"
2,"The Type 2 Diabetes Answer.: Of the five books that I've read on diabetes, this is the one that has all the answers. I've been on Dr. Bernsteins blood sugar normalization and weight loss program for 6 weeks and have lost 21 pounds, with no craving for carbohydrates!! The program works because the author(a Type 1 diabetic)hasworked out all the answers from personal experience."
1,"Good songs, but I have heard them all already: The Dissapointed. Why do I need demos of all the songs already on Apple Venus 1. Let's bring on Apple Venus 2, after all, isn't that what we were promised?"
1,"thumbs down: I don't actually own this album, but I did buy Apple Venus, and I'll say this: I hope that this album has the charm that that album lacked. I've never been so disappointed with an XTC album. Why would one buy an album of the exact same songs, except in demo form? A shoddy attempt to extract money, it seems. Shame on you, XTC!"
2,"Very nice: Yes, the arrangements are almost identical to the studio release. But in many cases the performances are superior. Vocals come through clearer; ideas are more obvious. It's a real testament to their musicianship/professionalism that the songs are so similar in demo and final form. Clearly, they are their own producers, rather than pretty faced fools who let others turn their songs into hits. Have some heart, pundits. They need the money. I read a long (and entertaining) interview where they described how much it cost to rent the orchestra for one day. It wiped out almost all the money they had. Yes, their own money. So if you wanna hear the second Apple Venus, quit yer yappin. This demo CD is for supporters and fans of musicians, rather than record companies."
2,"I think you're missing the point.: I think a couple of people are missing the point... The reason this is out is (I heard) they didn't have the cash to finish AV Vol 2, so this would generate some cash AND be of interest to their core fans. Plus, the demos ~are~ a good insight to their creative process.... I ~love~ to see the rough drafts... If you're just waiting for Vol 2, why did you buy this in the first place?"
1,"Lame: Recipes are a bit strange and not easy to follow. I wouldn't recomment this book at this time for anyone serious about cooking."
1,"These chip: The price is right and these mugs have a great shape for easy handling. I wish I could say buy these, But...the rims chip very easily. Someone else stated this in their review should of followed their advice."
2,"Just the perfect thing.: I only use these during the winter, but they are so wonderful for warm winter drinks. Hot chocolate with whipped cream, hot apple cider with a cinnamon stick, hot buttered rum, mulled wine, homemade egg nog. Mmmmm.When I received these I promptly dropped one on the tile from about five feet. It damaged my foot on the bounce more than it was damaged. Actually, it was completely fine - not a single chip. Big, thick, durable - everything they should be."
1,"Not for Boiling Liquids?????????: I contacted Anchor Hocking and they said that they do not recommend liquids over 160 F degrees to be placed in these mugs. Other reviews seem to imply that people do put boiling liquids in the mugs, but the company does not seem to sanction this use.I have had glass mugs crack on me before because I was not as careful as I should have been in reading the advertised claims, so I am now very carefull. I passed on this product, although they certainly do look beautiful."
1,"fragile.. fragile....very fragile...: I've had 6 of them for 1 month and one of them got lips chiped out already. (which one of the reviewer already commented that it happens often with these mug). It was sadly tossed out and now I'm worried they will eventually all dissapear out of my kitchen.Keep them apart from each other when you wash them. The slightest touch will chip it out unexpectedly.BTW: You can buy them individually at Bed and Bath Beyond for less price."
1,"Nice Basic Mug: I like the size and style of these mugs, they go with anything and look like they'll last a long time.--- EDITED REVIEW --- Long term? not very durable. All but one have broken."
2,"size of mugs: The mugs are very nice, but I guess I didn't think of the 16 oz. size, as a result they are much larger than I would have liked them...other than that they are very nice and will be put to use..."
2,"feel good music: This CD is typical of what your would expect from Idle Cure, good, old fashioned rock 'n' roll with Christian tones and themes. The music is inspirational and makes you feel good as you listen to it. I think any Christian rock fan would enjoy this. Idle Cure has a unigue sound that sets them apart from other bands. Give it a listen- you will like it."
1,"Core Sports Performance: A complete disappointment and waste of time. The narrator couldn't seem less interested; almost as though bothered by the project. Look somewhere else for a sports hypnosis cd."
2,"Very impressive book that deserves its high reputation.: This may have been written for professional military scholars and experts, but it is also of immense value to amateurs and military buffs. This is solid, heavy going but deeply analytical and more informative than any other book on the subject. It ranks alongside Ziemke and Bauer, David Glantz, and John Erickson (who have written a stunning review of it) as a top Stalingrad book."
2,"Lufwaffe operations from the Crimea to Stalingrad: An exellent study of the German Airforce from the fall of Sevastopol in the Crimea to its failure at Stalingrad. Very well written, with a clear analysis of the events. Well worth the money and it belongs in every major collection on World War II's Eastern Front."
2,"Unsurpassed in importance!: The first edition came out in 1998 and, six years on, this work has not been surpassed for its importance as an analysis of WWII joint warfighting, the Luftwaffe's way of war, airpower in the Crimea, airpower in the Caucasus, airpower at Stalingrad, and naturally the Stalingrad airlift itself.The reasons for this book's immediate ""classic"" status are easy to pick: totally accurate citing of hundreds of never-before-used sources in several languages drawn from major archives; a highly original approach to the writing of campaign histories; a clear argument; a fair and balanced approach; no Wehrmacht-devotee comments or tone (all too common I'm afraid); a wonderfully readable writing style; and precise footnotes that help the reader to determine the reliability of all claims or statements.A true model of a WWII campaign analysis. VERY highly recommended!"
2,"AN EXCEPTIONAL WORK: This volume is a major contribution to the history of the Luftwaffe during the Russo-Germano war. ""Stopped at Stalingrad"" is also a richly drawn study of the most important air campaigns in the Eastern Front. Written in an accessible style this volume will be welcomed by anyone with an interest in the WWII. I was very pleasantly surprised by the book and also the quality of its contents. The author did a masterful job of research. Joel Hayward draws on diaries of both key commanders and regular airmen. He also shows that the poorly conceived strategies of Hitler and his buffoon, Goering, dommed the efforts of men such von Manstein, Milch and Wolfram von Richthofen (an outstanding soldier) to come to grips with an impossible situation. I heartily recommended this book."
2,"Very good book: This is a very good description of Luftwaffe Operations on the Eastern Front. It has good background information speciffically about the economic side of it. Decisions made based on oil supply's rather than military objectives. Very interesting material.The only bad thing about this book is that the editing comes across as very sloppy. German names are often misspelled or incorrect. It is not Manstein, but von Manstein, not Bock, but von Bock, not Kluge, but von Kluge.Also it is not Count von Sponneck but Graf von Sponneck. If you overlook those issues, it is a very good book"
2,"A must-have for everyone interested in the Stalingrad Battle: Recently I ordered 'Stopped at Stalingrad' from amazon.com. It was well worth the puchase, as the book is both a profoundly researched study and an interesting read. It's a scholarly work which, undoubtedly, will become a classic in its field.D̩nes Bern��d, Aviation Historian and Author"
2,"Good Book on Eastern Front Luftwaffe: I learned a lot about the Eastern Front Luftwaffe. It is as much a study in the personalities as it is a history, strategy book."
1,"Sufi is inSUFIcient: Seeking more knowledge of Sufism was my main reason for reading Catching the Thread. The description of Sufism was too scattered over the chapters for me to put the pieces together in a satisfying way. Just one chapter summarizing the basics would have made the difference. The amount of dream material was excessive. Why not just a few extensive case examples. It is impossible for me to judge the quality of the dream interpretation, given the limited information on the dreamers. Most of the applications of Jungian concepts seemed appropriate to me. For those unfamiliar with Jungian psychology, this book serves as a useful introduction."
1,"Not authentic: The title of this video mentions Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, what is being taught on this tape is not authentic Argentine Tango. Not even close. It's ballroom tango. There is a huge difference: in music, style, steps, posture, etc... Don't be fooled by ballroom instructors trying to teach Argentine Tango. The only authentic instruction available on the market comes from authentic Argentine instructors from Buenos Aires."
1,"Much ado about latin ballroom tango: This version of tango is not argentine. It is ballroom latin american whatever you call it. Very misleading to call it argentine tango. But if you like ballroom dancing, maybe this video is for you."
1,"How Not to become a good Argentine Tango dancer: This video is fine for ballroom dancers, but it has nothing to do with the authentic Argentine Tango. Even ballroom dancing has now a separate category for Argentine Tango. Unfortunately, this video is not that. That's why, I rate it at 1."
1,"Overpriced: The price is too high for a VHS tape. Also, the title is misleadig, as Latin dancing has nothing in common with Argentine Tango. If you are NOT interested in authentic Tango Argentino, and don't mind paying the high price for ballroom instruction on tape, then this video is for you."
1,"too dark to see the instructors.: this video has a lot of dances for learning but each dance has only 3 steps so dont expect so much from this teaching video. if you want more than 3 steps then buy videos exclusively for a particular dance. this video will just wet your appetite but will not fill your hunger. also, the background setting of this video is very dark as if you are inside a dark night club so you cannot see the footsteps of the teachers because both of them were wearing black pants that blend with the dark background, terrible! plus the teachers teach from the side of the camera and sometimes facing the camera. this is not the ideal way to teach dance in a video. the teachers should be back to the camera so you can follow their footwork. for the money they charge for this video is not worth it."
1,"Tapes don't work for me.: There are a few things I didn't like about the tape. Firstly, the price is too high. Secondly tape is inconvenient for a spoiled by technology user. It's much easier to work with DVDs and their menus. And lastly, I realized that I'd rather spend 70 dollars on 4 monthly group lessons and learn basic steps and routines of one dance then try to master all by myself while watching a tape."
2,"Written with complete candor.: The Rangers have a very interesting and colorful history. Unfortunately, not much of it positive. Nadel fills in all the blanks that existed from the Rangers formative years, stories that were too sensitive at the time they occurred, i.e. Rogelio Moret's mental illness, something that was never addressed in the papers of the day. I assume the Rangers had a say in the editing of this book and I commend them for not trying to make Nadel whitewash the team's history.This book is where history begins and ends if you follow the Rangers."
2,"excellent: I bought the 1999 version and am about to order the newest edition. I had not been to Disney World in 12 years so I had no idea on what to do and where do go. The book was right on about every detail. I especially like the ride advice for little ones and the hotel recommendations. If you are planning a trip, buy this book first!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"Good Reference for Disney World: We're gearing up toward a Disney World vacation late this August, and have relied on this book thoroughly. It isn't the most comprehensive book, but it offers lots of good advice. Good thing for any travelling family."
1,"this book was a big dissapointment: I found this book to be very out of date. I can't count how many times I read ""coming in 2000"" and then no info on the subject. I didn't expect this from a book written for 2001. I have the 2000 official guide and it is much more up to date. The only thing I liked about the book is the coverage of non disney parks. This book was a huge waste of money."
2,"Great Info...especially about the Disney Cruise Line: We were looking for a book with information about the Disney Crusie Line with children. We are taking our daughters (9 and 13) on the Disney Wonder in February 2001, and we were looking for some insight that our travel agent couldn't give us. This book explained everything from check in at our Disney Resort to boarding the ship....it also explained all the activities available for our children and the dining schedules. I definately recommend this book to anyone who is looking for the same information that we were looking for!! (or any information on Disney with kids!!!)"
2,"Intro to Geography: People, Places, and Environment (4th Edition): I used this product for my World Geography course in college. A decent text book and a lot cheaper than what the college store was asking for. A few typos and a few wrong facts but other than that a pretty good text book."
2,"Thumbs up: Great product. Now I'll be able to study for my final exam andNot worry about depending on others to help me study."
2,"Quick service!: I ordered this book for school and expected to get the book within a few weeks. I received the book less than a week later! The book was in the same condition that was listed. I would recommend this seller to anyone needing textbooks at a good price."
2,"Mercer Mayer Books: All 3 of my children, ages 25 to 13 have had the Mercer Mayer books and loved them - I am now buying for my 3 year old grand-daughter, and she too loves these. I think these are a must for every child!"
2,"Timeless: I love these books and I've started one of my nieces on the little critter series which she is loving. Especially when she sees a small mouse of something in the corner of the picture, she thinks it's really cute and funny."
1,"Not as good as most: I love Little Critter books, but this one isn't as good as most. It is cute, and my kids like it fine, but others are better. I think my favorite are the ones titled ""Just Me and...."""
2,"Blaze Horse Books: C.W. Anderson wrote a wonderful series of books about the adventures of Billy and Blaze. I read them as a child, probably more than once, so I bought the entire series to read to and give to my horse-loving granddaughter and grandson. These books are classics."
2,"A Classic!: My 5 year old twin boys have just begun to enjoy this series of books after reading two of the Billy and Blaze books saved from my own childhood. I decided to complete the collection for them and have bought all the other books. These classic boy-and-faithful-horse-adventure stories have a timeless appeal that have been a joy to revisit for me and to discover for the first time for them."
2,"Cassie is AWESOME: I started reading Cassie Edwards books this yr. I was into the Harlquin Super Romance Books and believe me, I havent picked one of the HSR books up since I first read this book. I have since got my mother and my best friend reading these books also. We swap books so often and everytime we see a new book by Cassie we grab it. She is an excellant write that I would not mind meeting and telling her in person that her books have touched me and my family. My love for my husband even grew stronger by the love the Indians show. I am working on my heritage (Cherokee) as we speak. Keep up the great work Cassie"
2,"A must read for those who love Indian romances.: 1877 - South Dakota to MissouriCassie Edwards' love for Indian romances is very apparent! I get the impression her heart and soul is poured into each romance she writes. THUNDER HEART like her others, is a revealing, honest, and romantic look at Indian history.Thunder Heart's band has been named Musti-Ponca (Warm Ponca) because the white man has moved his tribe to Missouri. On the trip his loss was tremendous, and now as they sit and wait on the white man, his chieftain father and his people are ill. Dede and her son Johnny first learn of the Ponca's existents when they hear the haunting songs of the tribe. Bill who lives with Dede in name only is out to seek revenge on the Indians for his painful loss. As he and others make destructive plans against Thunder Heart's tribe, Dede makes plans of her own.Ms. Edwards paints the canvas of her romance with some colorful characters, interesting historical facts, and a steamy romantic moment or two."
1,"Nice Title!: It's rather amusing that some harmonica band (or whatever the hell it is) decided to give their album the same title as one of the greatest rock albums in history (Styx: Pieces of Eight). And to Mr. ""Please push sales"" who wrote the other ""review"": I bet your cover art isn't QUITE as good as the incredible Hypgnosis masterpiece of the Styx album. ;-)"
1,"DVD PhotoPlay Doesn't Work: I bought this software one month ago. I was required to immediately update it to fix problems that existed with the version I bought. I was able to navigate the program with ease and build a slide show with-in minutes. Now, for the bad news. It would not burn onto a cd-r as described. I contacted v-coms tech support and received a response within a day or two. The patch did not fix the problem and now after several attempts to reach them again, it seems I am stuck with another neat idea that doesn't work. Still waiting for help."
1,"Not worth it!: It wasn't long before I realized I just wasted (my money) on this near worthless software. No transitions effects/No ability to burn multiple albums to a VCD/Horrible music timimng!/No SVCD support/Music drop outs during slideshow. Sorry but I can't recomend thissoftware to anyone!!!"
1,"Save your money!: I received this software as ""bonus"" with Photo Explosion Delux. It's terrible. Was easy to create the slideshow and it looked great on my computer. Tried it on 2 DVDs and it didn't play. Tried to re-record it on a CD-RW and it still didn't work! It did run on my husband's laptop, but out of 6 computers I tried it on at work it only was recognized on 1! Very frustrating software. SAVE YOU MONEY FOR SOMETHING BETTER."
1,"Horrible!: I just recently purchased this near worthless software and found out very quickly that I just wasted [my money]! The music timing is all up to you!(so why did I buy this program?) They give you a chart and you must arrange the number of pictures to fit the music or else your slides end in an awkward manner without music or overrun. Yes you can adjust the time for all the slides but it's in 1 second intervals and in a 50 picture show that's 50 secondsa show you can be off by because you can't adjust each frame it's all or nothing. ..."
1,"Not worth your time: This product is anything but fast, complete, and easy as it claims to be. Unless, you already own Powerpoint it is also useless. You cannot add text or graphics to your photos unless it is done in powerpoint and imported into DVD photoplay. As far as adding background music good luck. The instructions tell you to compress the files and then combine into one large file then once you go to burn the cd it won't recognize the audio size you were told to convert to.I would not recommend this product to anyone. The concept is great one but failed miserably in it is claim to be fast, complete, easy, and flexible."
1,"THIS SOFTWARE IS GARBAGE!: I got this as bonus software on a Photo Explosion Deluxe package. I installed it, I made sure my photos were .jpgs, etc. I mean, I'm not stupid and I can read the simple instructions. It previewed on my computer just fine. I'm running XP-Home. Anyway, I can't burn the CD... it goes through the motions then it gives me one of 4 different reasons it won't burn. I called Tech Support. One guy was really rude, the next guy was good and said he'd send a new installation disk that day. Two weeks later, I got it. Uninstalled the program, reinstalled from the new disk, and OH BOY! A FIFTH ERROR MESSAGE. My computer is new, fast, and has an extra graphics card. 10GB hard drive, 512, the works. I am so sorry I got so excited about this worthless piece of software. BUY SOMETHING ELSE!"
2,"Absolutely Worth It !!!!!: Just as you might have seen in the theatre, BD provides better sound and vision for all the viewers, especially HD resolution does come in handy compared to the old cable TV channels. Somehow I didn't give it a 5-star it's because the box looks kind of damaged outside. The fact that I want to keep it a collection, which a rough look on the ouside doesn't adore me too much. Well...I guess that's the only flaw I could come up with. Besides that, videos quality and sound look just fine to me."
1,"Just buy from amazon not an indie seller: I ordered it new and it came in in an already opened case and it was fairly poor condition I had to tape it for it to stay together....enough said"
1,"Wait for the ""final"" boxset to be released: This DVD Trilogy box contains the two-disc editions of SM 1&2 and the single-disc edition of Spidey 3. However, 1 and 3 are available separately in 3-disc sets, and I'd be surprised if 2 wasn't given the 3-disc treatment right before Christmas. So, when the 3-disc editions of all 3 movies are available in one box (think Ultimate Matrix Collection), then that will be the one to buy. This box can be skipped."
1,"Spiderman 3 was horrible.: Personally I would NOT buy the trilogy because spiderman 3 was horrible, 1 & 2 where great though. 3 not so good!"
1,"Why am I re-buying this again?: Great picture quality, cool, and Blu-Ray is the premier format for all of its seamless feature interaction, and high storage capacity for more bonus material.... except Spider-man 1 and 2 have no special features (aside from the 2.1 stuff). Great use of space, thanks for all those perks, BR.So, I have to wonder, is it really worth the $70 to pick this up again?"
2,"Excellect Value and Fast Service: When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products."
1,"did not purchase: why am I being asked to review a product I didn't purchase. Need to fix the system or allow me to delete the request."
1,"Blu Ray for 1& 2 has none of the DVD extras.: Spider-Man 1 & 2 Does not include any of the amazing behind the scenes content originally released on the DVDs. Why would a studio release two extraordinary FX films of this magnitude and incredible production values on a format that can hold so much information, and fail to include the extras? If you're a fan of behind the scenes content, hold onto your DVDs.Movie - A+. Blu-Ray value for Spider-Man 1&2 - FAIL."

1,"No spanish audio nor subtitles for 2 & 3: Good fun movies and nice compilation but... Spiderman 2 and 3 do not offer any audio or subtitles in spanish. If like myself you need them, then don't buy this version. Look for each one individually for a version that has at least subtitles."
2,"Worth the Purchase if You Own an HDTV: I bought this DVD set as my first foray into the world of Blu-Ray and I must say I am not disappointed. The picture quality (especially on Spider-Man 2 & 3) pops off the screen even in 720p. If you're thinking of buying these movies in HD I'm sure you've seen them already in some other format so I won't bother reviewing the films themselves. The reason I gave these DVDs 4 stars instead of 5, however, is because of the complete lack of extras on the first two movies. Also the amount of grain is higher in dark scenes in Spider-Man compared to the other 2 sequels (which have almost none). Other than these small complaints I would say definitely pick this set up if you want some nice demo discs for your collection."
2,"Spider-Fan: I cant wait to get this movie on Blu Ray..I already own the first 2 but its gonna be worth seeing them on Blu Ray in HD!!"
1,"Poor quality of wrapping: I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."
1,"Sipder-man ""The High Definition Trilogy"" [Blu-ray] only works on PS3: I agree the comment from reviewer GWIRTH ""ginnyww"". Somehow these Sipderman blu-rays are not norm. They can only play on PS3. No luck with Samsung blu-ray players, not work with Sony blu-ray players either. Manufacturer needs to check what's going on. I also checked two sets of Sipderman blu-rays, one set from Fry's electronics, another set from Amazon, same problem, so that is not random disc defects."
1,"WANT REFUND!: The movies do not play in my xbox 360 console, which is my only source of a DVD player. i would appreciate a full refund considering i had to wait over 3 weeks just to get the DVDs that don't work."
1,"AUDIO: Russian, Czech and Polish: I bought this item because on Amazon I could see AUDIO: Englsih, French and Spanish;I am spanish speaker. I have the package now,but with Czech, English, Russian, Polish and Hungarian audio only (even spanish subtitles); the problem is that I can't send the movies back because I live in Latin America and is very expensive.This is a fraud, I have only one option...throw away the films. I have spent my money on garbage.COMPR�� ESTE PAQUETE DE PEL̍CULAS PORQUE EN AMAZON DICE QUE TIENE AUDIO EN INGL��S, FRANC��S Y ESPA��OL; MI SORPRESA FUE QUE AL RECIBIR EL PAQUETE SOLO TIENE AUDIO EN CHECO, RUSO, INGL��S Y POLACO, EN ESPA��OL NI SIQUIERA SUBT̍TULOS. NO PUEDO ENVIAR DEVOLVER EL PAQUETE PORQUE VIVO EN LATINOAM��RICA; LA �_NICA OPCI��N ES TIRARLO A LA BASURA. ESTO ES UN FRAUDE."
1,"Doesn't work!: We have ordered this DVD set 2 times and we have had to send it back each time. We also bought a set a SAMS CLUB today and it doesn't work either. Yes, we tried to play all 3 discs and in every DVD player in the house. We LOVE the movies and wanted to share the fun with our son who is now so disappointed. Save your receipt!"
1,"this is not a region 1 set: I bought this set for my husband and brother for Christmas last year then we ended up buying a different set for the movie cash for the new movie. I went to sell this set at used movie retailer and they informed me it was from overseas and possibly a bootleg. WATCH OUT!!!!!!!!"
1,"Toby McGuyre Spider-Man suffers in comparison: Lets state the obvious - Andrew Garfield in The Amazing Spider-Man is light years ahead of Toby McGuyre. Toby is nerdy and homely to the point of neurosis. Andrew's Spidey is bookish, but also skateboards in his high school's halls. Agressive, bold and self-assured. Taller, leaner, way better looking; Andrew's reboot of the franchise makes these 3 earlier McGuyre Spider-Man films suffer by comparison"
1,"Worst yet!: Amazingly silly dance routines. Baaaad acting. Lame, lame, lame story (I particularly love how the meteorite happens to land right next Peter and Mary Jane while making-out on a giant self-made web). And all for a mere $60 retail. Thank god for Amazon! If you're into this sort of thing that is. Don't let the effects dazzel your brain, this is truely one of the worst comic book movies, yet. And it's Spiderman, how can you screw that up."
2,"Great value: I got this for 40 something dollars and it was a great vale for my pocket, plus the great pic quality"
1,"Not a real collection boxset.: I like the movies and I want to add this trilogy to my DVD collection. However, this set is not a collection boxset that I am looking for. They are 3 separate spiderman movies in their own packages, and bundled together in a newly design cardboard box and called them ""Trilogy"".The worst is that they are the unsold inventory which they applied white stickers to cover the barcode in the back of each box. I felt cheated by Sony Pictures. They should have done a better job by creating a real boxset in a nice package with some additional materials.If you are looking for a nice collection boxset, please skip this set."
1,"all three discs skip: After I purchased these movies, I did not watch them right away. Once i did watch them I found out that they all skip badly. Unfortunately it was already passed the return date policy."
2,"What you would expect: Packaging is Ok but not great. Blu-Ray transfers are more than adequate. Fast shipping. There are a few different Blu-Ray collections out there and I am happy I went with this one."
2,"This is HIGH DEFINITION!: A wonderful, exciting adventure in the best HD I've seen so far. Whomever said any of these movies was ""grainy"" didn't watch it on a TV as good as my Mitsubishi Diamond Series.The story was great and endearing, the casting was great, Spiderman was perfect and the HD was breataking.This is what good movies are all about: telling a story, using artistic means to do it, and have a great cast to do it.And, of course, the ending was great too."
2,"I Can See Clearly Now.....: The picture quality is among the best I have seen for a blu-ray. The sound quality is pristine. I rocked the house playing it through my home theater system. The reason it got 4 stars was for the lack of special features for both Spider-man and Spider-man 2. This set included Spider-man 2.1(Extended Version), which was nice, so the trilogy is almost a quadrilogy. I waited for a price-drop since I had all on dvd prior to my purchase."
2,"Great: My son just started getting into superheros and Spiderman was at the top of his list. I found the triology on Amazon right away and at a great price. The movies arrived in very little time and in great shape. I love Amazon and will always continue to shop here.Tiffany"
1,"Perfect if I Lived In Europe: Received DVD's with no issue. The problem was that they were formatted for a region other than the United States. This is strange to be due to the fact that they were shipped from an American address to an American address. Amazon refunded my money with no issue."
1,"Movies good but set is very cheap in quality: Felt like a cheap knockoff. Definitely works well for people that just want the movies but no money or effort was spent on the container."
2,"Spider-Man - The Motion Picture DVD Triology: This item was a gift and I am basing my review on the three movies which I have seen."
2,"It's Spiderman: I'd seen all 3 movies prior to this purchase, however, this now enables me to view any of the 3 whenever I feel like it. My only commentary is, ""It's Spiderman"". I think that says enough. I'm well pleased with the delivery terms, condition and quality of the products."
1,"Have not recieved it: I can't rate this item because I have not received it. I have had this problem when I tried to order the toy story pack of one and two."
2,"Awesome Blu Ray Set!: This blu ray trilogy set is absolutely worth picking up. I do have all 3 movies on dvd, but this is one film franchise I don't mind double dipping into. The transfers to blu ray are spectacular. Great picture quality, and sound. My only complaint is that the special features for the first 2 films are non existent, but like I said, I have the dvds so if I needed to get my special feature fix then I could just pop those in. If your like me and love these movies, then do yourself a favor and get the set. You won't be disappointed!"
2,"light, tasty and healthy: Great taste, although a higher in calories than some of the other cereals and good in Folic acid and heat healthy.Wonder why it is not available at the local grocery stores?"
1,"There are much better train CDs out there than this!!!: The picture on the front of the CD is very deceiving. It shows a steam engine (an American-type steam engine, as a matter of fact) and there are no sounds of steam in the entire CD. All you hear for 90 percent of the time are slick wheels running on rails -- no engine sounds, no locomotives working hard or switching. In my opinion, this album is not worth the money for steam rail fans. If there had been a picture one of the European (or Asian) electric-powered trains that you hear on this CD, I would have never bought it."
2,"excellent!: Excellent overview of the history of Paganism. The paperback is in horrible fine print, though. This should be on every bookshelf, as it dispells myths while humanizing the myth makers."
2,"I wish I could give it 10 stars!!!: FINALLY!! A REAL historian who writes from a position of sympathy towards modern witches and pagans while unceremoniously debunking most all of the pet fantasies held by many feminist oriented authors today. Of course, I don't agree with ALL of what he says here, but boy did he ever open a can of worms and make me think! I am so glad this book is out there and hope that it finds its way into the syllabus of some of the Christian colleges. I know....but we can hope, right?"
2,"Phenomenal!: Anyone interested in Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca really should own this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is fluff-free and academically, though not poorly, written."
2,"How a religion is Born!: This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!"
1,"linear thinking loud equals authority: idotic to credit Robert Graves with inventing the Goddess. false authority. beware. sounds impressive but shoots self in foot repeatedly."
2,"Worth Reading: Hutton more or less aproached the book as an unbiased historian instead of going out of his way to critique Wicca. Although just stating the facts in itself makes wicca look silly. I'd recomend reading this book. As much as I dislike Wicca the history and evolution of it is interesting.Wiccas roots are in freemasonry, crowleyish occult b.s and well meaning but flawed writers like Yeats, Frazer and Graves. Once you get past where its roots lie it gets even worse. Wicca has absolutely nothing to do with true Heathenry. Its more or less a bunch of made up crap. I look at Wiccans as borderline retarded goofballs and roleplayers. I don't spend much time worrying or thinking about them, but I hate that most peoples perceptions of Celtic Heathenry comes from wiccan non sense and that they are making inroads into the Asatru community."
1,"will it never end!?: Small print, difficult to read. But wait - I might learn something here. So I use a magnifier and plug away. Nope - boring. There is absolutely no reason this research cannot be presented more simply. Well, maybe the author just wanted to impress other academics by being obscure. I hope he succeeded. But this isn't for ordinary people who want to understand the history and development of neo-paganism. There are lots of other, better written, more accessible, books out there that do a better job!"
2,"Long Overdue: This is a pioneering work, the first history of the Neo-Pagan movement which (note Mr. Hutton himself admits the diffculty of the task)gives a full scholarly review of the Pagan movement, its history and the ideas and cultural background of its tenents. Outstanding!"
2,"Excellent History of the Development of Wicca and Modern Paganism: I loved this book- as a neopagan it gave me insight into how much of Wicca, and in turn, neopaganism developed. I realize it does only focus on Wicca itself and that there were several other movements contributing to the rise of Neopaganism, but the book's title states the topic so no reader should be expecting much else! On the flip side, because they helped contribute, Freemasons, Aleister Crowley, and others are covered even though they themselves were not Wiccan. Overall, excellent book, well-written, and a must-read for any and all people even interested in Neopaganism, Wicca, or modern witchcraft!"
2,"camcorder cable: This is a must have cable if you're going to transfer your videos to your computer. Sony does not supply the cable with its HD camcorders. If you edit your videos and/or make DVDs, you will need this cable."
1,"Annoyingly necessary profit generator for Sony: Works as described. I am just so annoyed that Sony would lure me into buying their video camera for a competitive price without including this cable, making the overall cost of the camera no longer competitive. It's smart for Sony to conduct business this way, but only in order to earn profit in the short term. You can bet I won't be suckered in to buying any more Sony products in the future, now knowing that this is how they run their business."
1,"I got the same thing from CompUSA $3.99: I was shocked at how expensive this is so I searched other sites for one. I found a 4-pin to 6-pin firewire at CompUSA's website for $3.99 TOTAL (free shipping!) This Sony cable works great, but I can't tell the difference between it and my cheap one...thus the one star."
1,"Cable not what it is sold as: Cable is sold as having the ability to transfer video from a camcorder to a PC.It doesn't do it. I spoke to the company and they told me that there is no cable that does that. I asked them why thet advertised this cable as being able to do it and he told me I should have known better. They then charged me 15% to take the cable back. You would be smart to shop elsewhere. They don't know what their products do and they charge you for their lack of knowledge."
1,"Undecided - Be cautious: It worked for about a month. Even when it did work it was a hit or miss thing. I had to fool with it for a while. Maybe it was because I bought the cheapest one available. Maybe it was a knock-off, who knows? I have yet to try it on another computer to rule out it not being the cord. Fair warning."
2,"Sony VMC-IL4615 1.5 Meter i.LINK 4-Pin to 6-Pin Digital Video Transfer Cable: The cable works great. I have been uploading Digital8 video to my processor for editing projects with no problems. The cord could be a bit longer than its 1.5 meters but that's not a major concern. It was a bit pricey, but the steep markup on cords is pretty common across the board. All in all a good purchase."
2,"Video cable: This was the perfect cable to upload my videos from my Sony video camcorder to my PC. Easy to setup and works with the installed software. Operates faster than expected."
1,"Upgrade computer: If you have a new computer or maybe newer that 2003 this cable will work if you are working with one older than that like me it doesn't work. So now I have this wonderful cable and waiting to get an upgraded computer to match."
1,"what a rip off, sony's using customers as cashcows, get the cable from apple instead for only $29!: I spent a couple hours, trying to get transfer DV from my camcorder to my mac powerbook. After hours and hours I had to realize that the USB cable delivered with the sony camcorder was absolutely worthless. If you don't own a sony VAIO (which in my opinion just a overdesigned peace of fancy 007 gear with an i.Link connection, which no other PC/MAC has)your getting frustrated pretty quick. I would have given the cable a 5 star rating, but the way I had to get the cable, by having to buy it seperately, is a big rip off. However I found the exact same cable in an apple store called ""Thin Fire Wire"". The exact same cable (1.8 Meter 4 to 6 pin to be exact) for only $29 and it works just fine. So check out an apple store near you and save some money.Shame on you Sony."
2,"good: good why would I want to keep writing writing and writing while all I wanted to say is good. strange."
2,"nice and simple: I looked everywhere for a nice, simple design. I must have browsed hundreds of different styles. Anchor Hocking's Bolera set is just right - simple but not obviously.The glass is just wide enough for cleaning thoroughly by hand and the bottom has a nice weight to it as well - not easy to knock over. The sides aren't terribly fragile, but they're not uncommonly sturdy either. I have broken a few."
1,"Phantom Glasses - Beware!: Ordered on September 24, 2005 -- delivery now estimated by Amazon ""sometime"" after December 24, 2005. Three months (or more) for delivery seems excessive. Amazon should be ashamed for treating customers this way."
1,"Complaint: I first saw this ad before Christmas, and decided to check back later. I have checked 7 times since then and the glasses are never in stock, but I should ""Get in line""?I don't shop at Amazon in order to be ""in line"" for 2 months.Does this stuff exist or is simply a method to get you ""on the line""?"
1,"Great graphics, no story line, no point.: great if you like doing stupid tasks in a tony hawk style manner. only problem is the time clock is always ticking making this an arcade adventure rather than a video game. Don't waste the money, good graphics or not, this game is not entertaining."
1,"Flatout is flat: This game has some good qualities, but the pure racing person will have issues, as you gain $ for running into objects and cars, which blows. You are in a race and losing, so blast your car and everyone around you to get $$ for the next race. Realistic? Not. They don't even have a view from inside the car, it is a bumper view with no part of the car visible. The interface with arrow buttons is bad, and you can't even race online, just by LAN. In short, stick with Leadfoot or DTRSC and you will be at least $40 better off.jc"
1,"Copy Protection Breaks Game: I have one of the newer AMD Dual Core processors. After installing this game I attempted to play and it bombed out.Searching on support forums, it appears the copy protection software has a problem with dual core processors (amd and intel). And it doesn't look like the game maker is going to release a patch any time soon. Too bad, I really like the original game and was hoping to have more fun with the sequel."
1,"If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you.: If you believe people have an eternal soul, this book is not for you. If you believe death is the end physically and spiritually, and you want your child to believe that, maybe you will like this book. I found it not comforting at all, and not what I want my child to believe."
2,"Helpful in time of loss: This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss."
2,"A great choice if you're looking for something simple: Very simply, with few words, this book explains that there is a beginning and an end. In the middle is life. Beginnings and endings are going on around us all the time. For plants, animals and humans too. Everything has its own lifetime, some short & some long.Doesn't overdo it in sentiment or with pictures. There is typically 1 pictured item per page, not a lot to look at. This is perfect for the premise of this book staying simple & too the point."
2,"You'll read it and discover why you need it: I used to think that there was no strategy, per se, to fishing a lake--a big tub of water you trolled until you got an arbitrary hit.This book takes an almost forensic view of a lake's features--water layers, vegetation, etc.--and shows how to read them and catch fish. It's much more detailed than I expected and I came away with a real sense of how to find trout as quickly as possible."
2,"Great books on fly fishing: I have read many authors on the subject of fly fishing. Dave Hughes is a great writer. He puts it in a language a beginner can understand. I am not a beginner but I really like to read his books. I had several of his books and gave them to our new county library. Then I missed them, so I went on amazon and re-bought several of them. Great service! Would do it again. Tight lines."
1,"Break too easily: My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past."
2,"Owned these for years, they're great!: I love the look of these, and they've been a great value--about seven years ago I bought four of all 4 sizes, and only two are gone (my grandchildren love the oversized ones)! In 40 years, I never found glasses that went with everything, and survived, so I'm stocking up with this large set of my favorite sizes. Thank you, Amazon.com!"
1,"Very ordinary performances, mediocre video quality: The musical performances here are quite dull. There is nothing wrong about them except that the musicians seem to be simply doing their job and nothing else. If I had paid good money for this concert in person, I would have been highly disappointed. The video quality is even worse. The DVD is cheap but not cheap enough to justify its purchase."
1,"Poor engineering: This series of DVDs offers some fine performances along with a great deal of annoyance. The top menu offers no access points to most of the listed repertory. Tried on several different machines the problem is persistant. At least the price is reasonable if you don't mind fast forwarding through all tracks to get to the later pieces."
1,"Difficult product: I bought this DVD for the Mozart Symphony #35. However, it is very difficult to access the work. I finally figured out that the only way to do it is to fast forward through the final movement of the Lebrun Concerto. This problem was in evidence on several different DVD players one of which can track DVDs with any region code. There are some wonderful performances on this series. Too bad the engineering is so poor."
1,"pitchshifter is not the same!: When i first heard about deviant, i thought it would be something great (judging by previous records and the way Ps developed in their musical style). But after finally listening thru it i suddenly realised PS was trying to go mainstream. Their new CD is so much alike with Korn or limp bizkit music it was terryifing. I couldn't understand why Ps chose to opt out of the electronics towards more punk/rock style. In general this CD has some good tracks (2 to be exact), but it not deliver the goods like the previous CD's did. I AM SORELY DISSAPOINTED!"
1,"What happened to Pitchshifter?: The Pitchshifter sound that has been forged over their last 5 or so releases, culminating wonderfully with ""www.pitchshifter.com"" has here been stripped to a watered-down sound that could have come from any of 1,000 other bands who are wasting our time (and money) these days. The Pitchshifter formula of brutal guitars mixed with programed drums and other industrial and electronic affects was unlike anything else on the musical scene. That sound is completely gone on this CD--reducing their punishing onslaught to something that MTV would have little problem broadcasting. A very disappointing CD."
1,"Why, Pitchshifter?: This album sucks bad. I can't believe Jello participated in this. The only reason could be the lyrics, which are the only thing good about this album. If I read the lyrics but never listened to the music, I would like something about this product. This music is mainstream pseudo-post-(wannabe)punk garbage a la Korn (who also sucks). Too bad pitchshifter changed so drastically. Their first few were really good."
2,"Brilliant: Once again Pitchshifter seems to have outdone themselves. With cuts like ""Hidden agenda"" and ""Condescension"" How can one go wrong. With Pitchshifter's hard-edged combination of punk, techno, and metal; and the brutal social commentary, this easily became one of my favorties."
2,"very good: i agree that pitchshifter has changed from their previous album, but i wouldnt go so far as to say they sound anything like limp bizkit (thank god), as one of the previous reviewers said. the entire cd is listenable, but some are quite a bit better than others. i would choose tracks one and seven as my favorites. as good as this cd is, it isnt as good as www.pitchshifter.com. i hope their style of music influences some other bands, because it can be a beautiful thing. heheh."
1,"Bratz Helmet: When I ordered this product, I didn't see a size chart and I was sent a size that is not suitable for the purpose intended."
2,"Classic movie: Gopichand Jasoos is a private detective. Bela who is Gopi's neighbor, is to marry Jeetendra on her fathers insistence. She wants Gopi to find out more about his character. Gopichand sets on his work. His simplicity leads him to other way and in confusion he follows Prem Chopra instead of Jeetendra, where he detects that Prem Chopra, along with his three friend is planning to loot a bank. Gopi informs Bela that Jeetendra is a man with evil thoughts. The bank is looted and unfortunately Bela's father is the manager of this bank. He and Bela approach Gopichand and thrusts him the work of getting back the loot. Does he succeed this time? Watch Gopichand Jasoos."
2,"Beautiful glasses at a great price!: These are very attractive looking glasses that feel very nice. They are well made and not flimsy, yet they are not heavy to hold. They make whatever you are drinking seem to be more of a treat."
2,"Great Everyday Glassware: Though the Carlyle glassware is currently out of stock, I decided to write a review assuming they'll be back. I bought these glasses over a year ago after noticing that I was down to mismatched glasses in the cabinet that I didn't like much.After looking around the store, I decided on these. Generally, I like to buy glasses at a physical store because of the ""touch"" factor. Each of the exterior widening ""steps"" in the design helps keep the glass from slipping from one's grasp. Simple, but very cool idea that looks good too. It's been great for kids (runs in the family). They come out of the dishwasher looking great. I also like the idea that this is an old design from the 1930's.Finally, maybe the best thing; they're tough, and don't break when you'd expect. We've accidentally knocked them off a side table onto our marble floor too many times and are always amazed that they're in one piece.These are great for everyday use and I highly recommend them."
2,"Wonderful: My mother brought the first book of the series with us as reading material on a 4 week holiday in Scotland. I imediatly fell in love with it and upon returning to Canada devoured the series. They are incredibly exciting and the series as a whole is a must read. I recommend them to anyone who wants a good plot at an easy writing level."
2,"Perfect Christmas gift!: Very happy with purchase. Item was shipped fast, nicer than expected and the price was very reasonable. Ping to be a nice Christmas gift."
2,"Ramazing: Wow..thats basically all i can say. I bought the cd, then realized that they were playin live like 20 minutes from my house. They put on an amazing show! They closed it with do you call my name, then went backstage. The crowd started chanting, ""ONE MORE SONG!!"" The drummer came out and started playing again. Then all the rest came back out and played one last song. Ra is underrated and a great bunch of guys. I got my cd autographed by all 4 and i got a picture with them. Buy From One, Duality, and SEE THEM LIVE!! My ears are still ringing."
2,"Awsome Album for an Awsome Band: This CD is absolutely great. They have some great full sounding tracks. I had heard a few songs on the radio, and so I bought the CD and absolutely loved virtually every song on the CD.Also had a chance to see these guys in concert, and personally thought they were better live than on the album. Dont pass up a chance to buy the album or see them live!"
1,"These guys really suck.: This cd is horrible!!! I thought that it might sound a little like there first, but it just sounded weird. It was so bad that when i put it in my cd player, i started bleeding from my ears. Skip this cd for gods sake and by something better like a rake or a loaf of bread."
2,"Never bought the first one, this isn't bad.: Considering how much bad music is out there these days, this was nice to come across. Covers a wide range of topics and moods, musicianship is pretty good. I'd recommend it to just about anyone. My tastes are usually heavier and more progressive - Rush, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Queensryche. But I like this disc too."
2,"Another RA Gem!: For those of you that read my review for ""From One,"" pretty much what I said in that review is a repeat. This is an excellent CD, though toned down ""From One,"" it still rocks. You can't go wrong with ordering BOTH at the same time (that's what I did). BTW, I think RA does ""Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic"" BETTER than Police originally did it!!! ;^)"
1,"From Zero to Unfortunately, Duality: When I first heard Ra's ""From Zero"" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more."
1,"17 years old and it shows: Well, I might have agreed with the other reviewers if I hadn't ordered ""Strength Ball Training"" by Goldenberg and Twist at the same time. This book seems very amateurish by today's standards. It's a thin paperback with hand-drawn sketches. Maybe this was considered okay back in 1991, but this is 2008. SBT gives you all of the exercises in this book plus many more, updated with recent training science background, illustrated with photographs of actual people, plus a DVD with videos illustrating many of the exercises! And it's the same price! Come on, get into this century. Amateur productions like this one just don't cut it anymore."
1,"So so only: Very basic . More challenging and rewarding exercises not covered . Many routines designed to be done with a partner than alone"
2,"Wonderful: It just helps to have God's word there for you in the area or topic you need to focus on. Very helpful and easy to use."
1,"poor service from amazon: wow this is the first time im ever writing a review for a cd i never got to listen to (thanks to the poor slow sevice from amazon).Ordered this item april 15 2011 .First i was supposed to get it by april 29th then they pushed it to may 27th poor timing for amazon because they screwed up a previous order .I cancelled this order it was supposed to be an anniversary gift for my husband .I suggest people be careful when ordering this product because it will take its sweet time getting there if it does at all or maybe you will get it by next year.I was being very generous rating 1 star not for the music but for the poor service i will not be re ordering"
1,"Not a scholarly book: The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people."
1,"Mindless and thoughtless: Regardless of you religious beliefs, this book is the biggest waste of time since Ernest Goes To Jail. PLEASE freakin' tell me these guys aren't college professors. Never has a less researched, less thought-provoking book ever been written. It is an insult to read. Don't waste your time."
1,"FOR LOVE OF GOD AND COUNTRY: Please I read this book to give chance to opposition but found no credibility in the writers themselves. No Footnotes come on. Please go to [...]or even better go to their wallbuilders live podcast and find out about what the forefathers intended. They talk of the true definition of seperation of church and state. While at the same time hold ownership of articles that are displayed at the Smithsonian. They own thousands of articles including forefather letters and journals. In their own words letting you know from fact that this was to be a God Fearing Nation. David Barton offers books with insight into this subject for real minimal prices. I have seen his books and cd's on amazon. Doesnt it make sense to trust the words directly from our forefathers hand written words, or atleast from some one that owns the actual articles. See for yourselves please. May God Bless America."
1,"This work has NO citations - not a scholarly book: This work has NO citations. It is not a scholarly book. The note in the back of the book mentions a few sources, but there are no direct citations for most of their ""godless"" assertions in the text of the book. Thus, the authors take huge liberties with their assertions. They ignore blaring facts such as over half of the signers of the Constitution had degrees in divinity."
1,"Brain washing: I would like note that if you look at the footnotes for this book as to where they got there information, they do not have a shred of evidence to back them up. They simply state they they have forgone the traditional footnotes and that we should believe them just because they have a PHD. I know that if I were writing any type of paper for these gentlemen in college they would fail me if I didn't show where I got my information. Furthermore, There is a man in Texas who has the world's largest collection of artifacts from our founding fathers and he has loads of evidence which point to the extreme opposite. In fact he has a copy of bibles that were printed and distributed to every family in America through funding from Congress. I would encourage anyone who sees this to watch the documentary called ""MONUMENTAL"" by Kirk Cameron, exposes the truth about our constitution writers and points out the damage that books like these have caused to our society."
1,"This is fallacious: wow this book is very misleading if your a layperson do your research. You will see this textbook everywhere but if you go to were the evidence is this argument completely falls apart are founding fathers printed the first English bible lol but yet these guys say there atheist and agnostic this is funny this book is not documenting a single thing."
1,"Baseless, made up propaganda: This is a book that is used in colleges across America, but contains almost no primary source quotes, no footnotes, no endnotes, and thus no scholarly support for any of it's assertions. Did the author even bother to read the founders' letters, speeches, published works, etc? Probably not, bc actual quotes from those who founded this country would really get in the way of their made up speculation, hearsay, and biased opinions masquerading as historical fact. Pathetic."
1,"the man from utah: the movie was so blurry you could hardly see it,it wasnt verygood thank you carol meeks"
1,"Definitely not her best.: Okay, this was the first Night World book that I read, and it seemed pretty good. But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first. I think that LJS's other books are a lot better. ~Ondine"
2,"Pretty Awesome!!: This book, was in my opinion, pretty good. Not one of her best, but it was good. I really liked the story, and I really liked the characters. To me, the story had a different meaning, than most people had seen. If you read between the lines, you see that this is what a lot of people hope for. To be popular, to be perfect in every aspect, and to have power. I really liked this book, and reccomend it to anyone who likes Lisa Jane Smith, or anyone who likes books about ""Creatures Of The Night"" :)"
1,"Everlasting Love--what else?: This book was not the best. It was boring and the characters were underdeveloped. I liked the idea that Gillian WASN'T gorgeous, rich, and plain perfect, but in a snap she became the typical LJ Smith character. I love the idea of soulmates and everything, but I think these kids find their soulmates too easily, and how come everyone in LJ Smith books have to be SO perfect? Maybe if they were not so gorgeous--really how many gorgeous people are there in the world who are ""perfect"" on top of that? If you want to read LJ Smith, read the trilogies or even the other Night World books because this book reads like LJ Smith was getting desperate for a ""new"" idea."
2,"This book is great! Get it now! Don't hestitate!: This book was wonderful and enjoyable, just like all the other Night World books. I was so smitthen with all the books that I even composed a poem on it.This book is greatGuranteed to make your eyes go redReally, I'm not lyingyou may even go swimming"
2,"Pretty Good: I've read all of the Night World books, and this is a great book, but I must say, it's not L. J. Smith's best"
1,"I can't belive LJS wrote this: I am a huge LJS fan, I have read almost all of her books well over 10 times except this one. It was so boring I really disliked to book. It didn't have anything to do with the NW until the book was almost done, and Gillian was so pathetic and whimpy. David.... I really didn't like his character at all."
2,"it was good i dont see the problem: it was different and maybe not her best but it was still good. i mean it did have soulmates in and we got to see ash again which gains any book about three stares however short a time its for. i hope as is in the last book"
1,"This book wasn't near as good as the others: Gillian came off as a wimp. Angel was ok. They should have made Gillian seem more like a real girl and not someone from a soap opera."
1,"the worst book in the entire night world series!!!: this is the worst night world book that i owned and im sure every1 agrees this 1 [is bad] alot/ first of all gillian is a stupid little sissy whining girl who cared only bout the stupidest things - being popular and getting her crush david to notice her obvioulsy she wasnt being herself she was just like every1 else- wanting to be popular like it was the most important thing in the world to her thats is very stupid of her 2nd the plot was really stupid and boring and didnt mention any vamps, witches, or shapeshifters or the night world in particular. another reason why this book [is bad] the only part i like is that there's an apppearance by one of my fave characters of the series-ASh i swear he would be more funner 2 read if the book was only bout him!!! angel wasnt a good character either and david [wasn't either]!! i recommend teens 2 not by this book it really stinks alot!!"
1,"not the best book!!: well first of all i thought that this was the worst night world book in the series and believe me i have and read all 9 of them. Gillian is just so shallow and a little sissy the only thing she wants is to be popular and have David as her bf like its the most important thing in the world!! i thought David was stupid too he seem to only fall in love with Gillian because of her transformation to being well liked he was just being shallow and really stupid. i think Gillian and David are the most stupidest characters in the entire night world series!! so far this was not the best book so far. the only part i liked was where Ash showed up i was totally happy when he was in this book. he is just funny and such a hottie to be with. the other books i recomend is Witchlight, Daughters of darkness, Soulmate, The chosen, and Black dawn."
2,"Angel?: Gillain, a shy girl, is rescued from near death by an angel.The Angel helps Gillain get things she never had, like poularityand the attention from a guy she likes, whose name is David (which has a girlfriend). Angel tells Gillain to hurt people to get what she wants. it gets to the point where Gillain can't take it anymore and she wants him to go away. Gillain gets into alot of trouble with Angel and doesn't know how to make him go away. So what Gillain does is she...*Want to know the rest, read the book and you'll find out*I'ts a really good book!"
1,"I can't believe she wrote this!: LJS's other books are great, but this one was so boring! There was absolutely nothing dangerous about Gillian and David being in love, and that's the whole point of this series! Also, it's kind of unlikely that someone could just cut her hair and wear makeup and then suddenly be popular. I didn't like Gillian at all. She's superficial, not to mention being Little Miss Weakling. David was an idiot because he fell for her as soon as he saw her with short hair and makeup. Let's get realistic! He cheated on the SATs and Gillian still wants to support him. Plus, he's BORING! LJS's other books are all 5 stars in my opinion, but I hated this one."
1,"Worst book by LJ!: Totally hated this book. Now, don't get me wrong, I love LJS and most of her books. Actually, all of her books except this one. Totally borring and predictable."
1,"Labor Can Do No Wrong: This old book (written in the 1950s) is published by a labor union because mainstream publishers would not touch it. Union people love this book because it makes union leaders out to be martyrs and saviors of the world, standing up to those mean, greedy old corporate capitalists. For these authors, the story of labor is black and white, no shades of gray. Labor can do no wrong and never has done any wrong. The Molly Maguires were not draft dodgers and murderers, but innocent martyrs who got framed. The Homestead rioters were poor oppressed immigrants asserting their right to take control of steel mills, and are not not to be blamed for beating and shooting the police or trying to assassinate the company president. The western miners headed by Communist Big Bill Haywood didn't really blow up mines with dynamite, the mine owners did it just so they could blame the union. This book isn't history, it's a cartoon of history. Don't look for any balance, objectivity or nuance here."
1,"Left-Wing Propaganda: This old chestnut of a book should be put out of its misery. It's written with style and a tone of authority, but careful reading shows that it is hopelessly slanted. On every significant point which involves historical uncertainty or controversy, the authors unquestioningly accept the left-wing/labor point of view and cynically disparage or totally ignore any other interpretation. This is Labor's ""untold"" story because no other reputable historians have ever had the nerve to write such an openly propagandistic book. Academic labor historians who think this book is so wonderful are merely showing their left-wing ideological colors. There are much better and more objective accounts out there."
2,"A Great Place to Start...: This is a must-read for anyone who wants to know where the modern labor laws and labor unions come from. It depicts in stark detail the criminal acts against American working people that do not show up in many textbooks."
2,"Asatru music in fine form: Hagalaz Runedance contains ten tracks of wonderfully composed and sung songs which are written from a heathen perspective. Asatruar everywhere will absoutely love this music. It's done in a celtic/renissance style which is easy to listen to as well as learn to sing yourself. The emotions range from haunted to joyous and loss as the songs recount tales of old, and of loss and of joy.Hail to Hagalaz Runedance for creating this excellent work which will uplift the souls of all who may hear it!"
2,"Not classic, but Inspiring haiku, bringing art into everyday: I received this book as a gift from a friend a couple of years ago which inspired our circle of friends to start our own little haiku challenge. The poetry in this book is a collection of snippets from the lives of ordinary but creative people. It proves that everyone can find a little bit of revelation in their lives, in things as simple as a map or mist rising in the cold. And by sending those little snippets to friends they stayed as much a part of each others lives as if they were right next door. I really recommend dipping into this collection and maybe even starting your own haiku challenge...it isn't meant to be classic haiku, but simply enlightenment in daily life, given with love from one friend to another."
1,"Three Lines Do Not Always Equal Haiku: Haiku is a Japanese lyric with a deceptively simple form: 17 syllables in three lines of 5,7,5 syllables. Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a ""season word"" and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there. Aspiring haiku writers would do better to consult the translations by R.H. Blyth, THE HAIKU ANTHOLOGY (of English language haiku) by Cor van den Heuvel, and the indispensable and well-respected THE HAIKU HANDBOOK by William Higginson."
1,"No stars but they all think they are and have stuff to say.: You can be a rock star and not have a clue as to what haiku is. This book has been around. It has been the brunt of jokes in the haiku community. I can't say I know how to write a decent haiku but if you google, you WILL find some great haiku poets. PLEASE - if you don't have this book, keep it that way. It may have been a year but not a haiku one."
1,"Definitely NOT haiku - poetry? Maybe...: This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"
1,"The only stars is the rocker: You make it in rock and you think you can do it all. This book proves you can't. It is a truly poor excuse for a collection of haiku and it is particularly offensive because there are those who will buy it thinking it the real thing. Do yourself a favor and buy Higginson. You can look at this in a few minutes in the bookstore. It might be good for advanced classes in ""don't let this happen to you!"""
1,"It's the end of haiku as we know it...: This is what has become of haiku in English- and it is all bad. Haiku in America in general is vastly misunderstood and each of the verses in this volume show it. Some have three lines, some do not, some have kigo, some do not. By the looks of this, one can deduce that these ""poets"" gleamed their knowledge of haiku from Kerouac (another haiku fraud) rather than Basho. This is just an experiment really, conducted by a circle of friends who jotted down their thoughts and sent them to one another. Please, please avoid this title if you really care about or want to learn about haiku. Amazon should allow ""0"" stars when rating items such as this!"
2,"Fun For Everyone: Witty and fun songs for everyone from as young as 2 to adult. Has a great message and highly recommended."
2,"The funniest CD out there: The whole thing is worth its weight in gold just for the ""dance of the cucumber"" song....El baile del pepino, el baile del pepino..hmm hmm hmmm...I LOVE IT"
2,"Funny and all around Great!!!!!!: Larry the Cucumber makes this cd hilarious!!!!!This is a great Christian cd with great music that you can sing along with and never get tired of. You are bound to enjoy this cd! It has great life lessons just like the movies. I recommend this cd to any one of any age. You will definetly enjoy!"
1,"Get ready for standardized test: Horrible product! Too much talking about general stuff. Not enough real tests. Very low level of expertise. it is just ridiculous how people can get published with such book about nothing. Bits and pieces here and there. Please, Amazon, do not sell this book - too little of material for too much money. It's a SHAME!!!!!!!!!"
1,"There is more to this story ...: I am the author of an article for ""The Skeptical Inquirer"" about the origins of ""The Mothman Prophecies."" The article, which appeared in the May/June 2002 issue, also may be read at the CSICOP web site.There, I describe the highly dubious role Gray Barker played in the background during the events surrounding this now-well-known West Virginia case. Barker was responsible for at least one telephone call (and possibly more) to John A. Keel and others in an attempt to generate interest in the Mothman and UFO accounts that were rampant at the time.Those who wonder what to believe about ""The Mothman Prophecies"" will gain greater insight into the situation by reading this article -- but only if they truly wish to understand that there is indeed ""more to the story."""
1,"poorly written nonsense: The author apparently has some theory relating to unexplained phenomena, but you'll never figure out what it is from reading this book. He strings together repetitive descriptions of ""unexplained"" events, without coherent narrative or structure.The book is filled with ludicrous claims about what ""scientists know"" or ""studies have shown."" Of course there's no support for the claims.Don't waste your time on this book."
1,"Boring: Garbage. The author is no different from the other 50,000 lunatics running around the country chasing lights. The only difference is this guy wrote a book. Watch the X Files instead.."
1,"Dull, Disjointed: Two hundred pages into the book, and I'm still waiting for a cogent theme to emerge. Poorly written, poorly documented, and thin...in other words, perfect fodder for a commercial movie."
1,"Bogus...bunk...B-A-loney: I enjoy reading about ""unexplained phenomena"". I really do. I love ""real"" ghost stories and the like. However, I prefer an author to take a very scientific stance, exhausting all possibilities. Keel does not. He's a ""true believer"" and that's the problem.Somewhere in the book he supposes that this mysterious Mothman could have been a man on a hang-glider. ""Wow,"" I thought. ""That could almost be construed as logical."" However, he IMMEDIATELY debunks that theory with a statement to this affect: ""But hang-gliders were not very well known at that time.""*shaking my head*Whatever...the man needed to become familiar with Occam's Razor."
2,"Good story, but very skeptical about the writer.: I like the book just because it was fun to read, but very skeptical about the way the writer admits he had seen ufo sightings night after night in chapter 10 of the book. My question is why in the world a guy like John Keel arms himself with only a flashlight and not a camera. He obviously sets himself up to see strange lights but does not bring a camera to capture the event. Unless he makes a book that has pictures for us to examine, and not hording all the evidence for himeself. Then I will have put him in the ""Good story teller"" catagory and not a ""ufooligist"". I must admit I am tired of all the hidden evidence about this matter, and I think we are all ready for the truth. If you want my opinion I just threw all his credibility in the bin. I must admit I really enjoyed this book."
1,"Disappointing: The Mothman story is indeed a fascinating one. Unfortunately, the same adjective cannot be applied to ""The Mothman Prophecies."" John Keel's theories regarding the nature and origin of UFOs in general and Mothman in particular are more bizarre than the phenomena themselves. I was also put off by Mr. Keel's tedious obsession with men (in black) behaving badly.I've given this singularly overrated book two stars, rather than only one, because it does supply some (albeit nowhere near enough) information on the extraordinary occurrences of more than 30 years ago."
1,"repetitive, lackluster: I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)"
1,"mothman-putting the loose ends together?: I found the movie leading in many directions....Why was John's wife appearing in Point Pleasent? Was this the mothman? Why did John appear for Gordon 3 nights at 2:30 a.m? These questions were never answered in the movie.... or did I miss something? The movie ran long for me, maybe because of the loose ends. I could be wrong, you decide. Go see the movie......"
1,"Very Detailed and Never Ending: I usually like the books better than the movie. It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time. The movie focused more on the actual ""mothman"" and I felt the book just mentioned it among many other things. This book should have been named ""Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink."" I was glad to be done with this book. Don't waste your money on this book, check it out from the library."
2,"Paranormal epic: This book is a rarity in UFO literature, primarily b/c most UFO books present their information in dates and names and places and events ... in a sense, completely without any feeling or substance beyond the 'happening.' The shocker of the ending of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES you already know if you read the 1st chapter, but, as you've been drawn further and further into the lives of the main participants, the ending hits you like a sledgehammer b/c you've spent the last 250 pages forgetting all about it. More UFO books should be written with this humanistic approach; perhaps then the subject wouldn't be so taboo."
2,"A must for Fortean buffs: Believe It or Not? Well, frankly, I don't believe all of it, though I'm sure those folks in West Virginia saw something mighty interesting. But in all the lengthy annals of Fortean/ supernormal/ paranoia-lit journalism, Keel does stand out as an author with an above-average storytelling ability. He also has the ability to not take himself entirely seriously, a trait often sorely lacking in the genre. With all that and a trans-phenomenon Grand Unified Theory of Weird Stuff to offer, this book is definitely worth checking out for those interested in the field."
2,"GET THIS BOOK WHILE ITS STILL IN PRINT: Investigators like John Keel don't seem to exist anymore, so get this book while it's still in print for an honest approach toward unexplained phenemenon. It will probably never be able to compete with the books that assure us we are being visited by ET's, angels/demons and/or ancient deities. People want something to believe in. ""Belief is the enemy"",warns Keel. How many paranormal researchers do you know would say that? We are goldfish in a fishbowl being watched over and toyed with, but by What? This is the question Keel will leave you with and that will keep you staring wide eyed up at the ceiling late at night in bed..."
1,"the movie was better: Usually the book is always better. In this case, no way. I found it to be just a bunch of disjointed ramblings and partial recounts of what happened. I couldn't even finish it and gave it away. The movie didn't follow the book at all, but at least there was a thread of a storyline to follow."
1,"Where's the beef or Mothman in this case?: There is a lot about the 60s' that for obvious reasons, I have forgotten but I do remember that there were a lot of Instamatic cameras and 8 mm movie cameras around so I guess my question is: Why are there no pictures of this thing? I believe the good people of Point Pleasant saw something as there were at least 100 reported sightings of ""Mothman"" and I simply cannot accept the author's statement that all those camera's that the newspeople took along failed to work for one reason or the other.The movie was excellent but then it was not based entirely on this wacky book which is written in kind of a random fashion and is not all that good in the first place. ""Show me the pictures."""
1,"Pretty disappointed: I saw the movie and was intrigued enough to read the book, which I thought would maybe give a better idea of what really happened in West Virginia that year. I was disappointed to find that Mr. Keel spent a lot of time dwelling on UFO encounters and the history of UFO encounters and spent little time talking about the events in West Virginia, other than how it blended with the history of UFO-logy. The movie was more interesting, and I don't know how they developed a movie based off of this book. I didn't buy the book to read about Air Force involvement (or maybe lack thereof) in UFO sightings or about how Mr. Keel had been hunting UFOs and UFO witnesses. A big letdown."
1,"Little Value: It is understandable why his other books, according to his own admission, were not well received.Mr. Keel offers some rather off the wall explanations with little or nothing in the way of proof except HIS word. For those unfamiliar with this subject, controversial as it is, the book may have some interest even if of very little value.Mr. Keel dismisses, with a wave of his hand, everything written by valid and serious investigations. Admittedly there are those who have written who do not deserve to be taken seriously and Mr. Keel is at the top of that list.Desmond"
1,"A waste of time: Don't get me wrong, I believe in UFOs and certainly Mothman, since my friend's aunt saw it, but 90% of this ""nonfiction"" book is nonsense. Keel's semi-acurate listing of the real life mystery of Mothman wins it a single star, but the speculation that he pushes as the gospel truth is laughable, and is mostly based on questionable facts and ideas that are theoretical at best. If you want to know about Mothman read James Cohen's Book of Mysterious Beasts, if you want to waste your time and Amazon's time, buy The Mothman Prophecies."
1,"So What: If you are looking for a great story that will really drag you into it, don't read this book. Lord help me I thought I would go crazy and only got through the first three chapters. There is not an ounce of structure to this. It's just a bunch of thoughts and ""reports"" of sightings of UFO's, ""mothmen"" and other oddities. I'm not sure if Keel intended for this to be a re-telling of things he believed really happened or if he honestly thought he was writing a novel. I can't take anymore, I give up and usually I'll read just about anything all the way through to give it a fair chance. All of these little scraps of sitings in no order whatsoever make me say... So what?!?!?!?!"
1,"Thoroughly Debunked: This book is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel's ""weird"" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting.""Mothman"" does not exist. Several writers--most notably Joe Nickell--have thoroughly debunked the incident. But true facts have never stopped Keel.I'm a fan of Keel's writings, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. This is not one of his best efforts, and it rankles me that he positions himself as a serious journalist."
1,"Mothman Fiction: The author claims the book is factual. My gut feeling is it's fictional. As fiction it is not well written. Just a bunch of short tales kind of mixed together."
1,"Okay!?...: I'll admit it, I didn't have a clue what was going on in this book (which claims to be real, but is obviously a work of fiction), nor did I really have much of a reason to.UFOs...Men in black...Mothmen...Abductees...government coverups...sightings...It's all here, and regardless makes no sense whatsoever.I actually walked into this thinking it was going to be great, that there would be a wonderful story based upon the legend of the mothman, but no I was bombarded with 266 pages of ""research"" having no really meaning, or thesis. Honestly, I say avoid this like the plague."
1,"Initially interesting, eventually saw through him . . .: It was recommended to me by someone whom I think beleives in the interdimensional and non-ET aspect of it all. I kept an open mind, but finally came to the conclusion that John Keel wrote a fradualent and contrived story, with an underlying ""distracted"" attitude that in reality is quite insulting to the reader. The book is probably pure fiction, and if you seek more than fiction, then it is bordering on pure trash. As an ""investigator"" he poorly documents his findings. Don't buy it, check it out from the library, please."
1,"Reads Like Keel's dropped his notes and never rearranged them: Excellent and suspenseful information. All over the place as far as the material. We travel back and forth from West Virgina to London to Ohio... and back again. Would have enjoyed it if the first part of the book was supporting information as to the phenomena itself and how it has indeed appeared elsewhere in history, how the phenomena ties to UFO sightings etc. but Keel's hypothesis that all paranormal activity comes from a parallel universe it difficult to believe, even for paranormal studies. I'm sure that is a first.Although the book was suspenseful and written well, it was just organized poorly. Revise, John. You can do it."
2,"Good Read: Good read. If half of what is written in this book is true; then are world is much stranger than we can imagine.One of my favorite books."
1,"Boring & Unbelievable Story: Normally, I prefer books to movies, but Mothman Prophecies was not only boring, but unbelievable. Non-fiction! The story was a product of the author's imagination. Perhaps in 1975, when the novel was first copywritten, it was spectacular. To those who are thinking of purchasing this book, (especially after viewing the movie) I'd say pass it up, and purchase the VHS or DVD."
1,"Unidentified Reading Object: I approached this book with a fairly open mind, expecting to read an interesting story about the strange events of 1967. Unfortunately, Mr. Keel's tendency to ramble and a strange, albeit somewhat fascinating, mixture of conspiracy theories, ""ufo"" sightings and Men in Black stories made the book an incoherent mess. The book begins and ends with the events of Point Pleasant, and spends the middle attempting to connect those events with literally hundreds of other experiences throughout the world and throughout history. ..."
2,"Interesting: This was a very fascinating read. It does not focus only on Mothamn sightings, but all the other strange events that were supposed to have happened. If you are looking for a book that will prove Mothman exists, I don't think this is the proper book for you. It is mainly about what went on from the first sighting of Mothman to the felling of the bridge. There were a lot of strange happenings during that time. I read this as ""I'm presenting you with the information as to what heppened as I saw it and was involved in it, and you make up your mind as to whether its true or not""."
1,"Not what you'd expect!: Although the movie was very well done for those who enjoyed a spooky and suspenseful story, the book however is not the movie. It seems that Hollywood took very few pieces from the book and turned it in to a great movie which is kind of the other way around from the usual book being better than the movie. This book is good if your a UFO buff only. It mentions the Mothman but other than that it was a very boring read as I expected to be reading about the same scenario as what I saw in the movie. I was extremely disappointed."
1,"huh?: I just don't get it? I thought this book was a story about the paranormal and all the town needed to do was buy some Raid.Also anybody can tell you moths just son't grow that big... now June Bugs well now that's a story."
1,"Amazon.com Customer Reviews...: Don't waste your time reading them...They tell you absolutely nothing. Each entry contradicts the other.Remember, humans write these things."
1,"Is this a first draft?: The little content contained is interesting.However, the entire book is short chapters of journal notes with the occasional splash of commentary thrown in.Badly written, poorly organized.He could have at least organized it chronologically.The constant way of making himself out to besome sort of superhero got very annoying very quickly."
1,"BORING!: The subject matter is fascinating and has the potential to make an exciting, fast moving read. Unfortunately the presentation is disorganized, repetetive and BORING. I had to force myself to finish the thing and ended up wondering what the heck the point was meant to be. I certainly didn't feel that I had acquired any clear understanding of what happened in Point Pleasant; I didn't even get enough out of it to decide whether I believe any of the stories or not. If you want the book, borrow it from someone and save your money."
1,"A Let-Down...: John Keel's ""Mothman Prophecies"" could be a great book if it actually concentrated on the ""Mothman"" sightings in and around Point Pleasant, West Virginia in the mid-to-late 1960's. Unfortunately, this book isn't really about the Mothman, but it should instead be entitled ""John Keel explains how the universe really works"". For every ""Mothman"" story that Keel relates in this book, he offers at least three other stories of his personal life, his adventures in researching the paranormal, and his decidedly offbeat theories about paranormal events and what causes them. This book isn't really about the ""Mothman"" sightings in West Virginia as much as it is a goofy memoir of John Keel's ""research"" into the world of UFOs, demons, ghosts, and other bizarre events. As someone who bought this book to read about the ""Mothman"" and not about Keel's disjointed ramblings and ravings, I was sorely disappointed. Not recommended."
1,"The Mothman in Bits and Pieces: This book is NOT like the movie. In fact, I prefer the movie. The book is composed of bits and pieces of John Keel's and others' phenomenal experiences. It is difficult to read, not only because of the bad press printing, but also because it is very clipped and disjointed. I bought this book to delve further after seeing the movie, and ended up more confused. Go to the movie--forget the book!"
2,"All Barsoom books are great!: I first read the Martian Chronicles as a teenager. They are in fact the only sci-fi I've ever read. What I want to know is why George Lucas or Steven Spielberg havn't made movies of them? With their abilities in the sci-fi world they could do a great job with them."
2,"Brilliant, Lagwagon's most ""complex"" album: The CD will not grab you at first, its not as catchy as Lagwagon's previous releases, but with a few listens it makes the argument for greatest Lag album ever. The flow through out the whole thing is perfect. The CD is dedicated to Derrick (the bands original drummer) and with that comes a lot of emotion, dealing a lot with reflection, moving on, and self-discovery, the lyrics here are very well crafted. I absolutly cannot stop listening to this record. It's got so much to offer. The highlights of the album for me ""Runs in the Family"", ""The Controtionist"" and ""Days of New"", which will most likley give you the chills if youre a die hard lagwagon fan.I truly belive that Joey Cape is one on the most incedible song writers of the past couple decades. Listen to Lagwagon along with his side project Bad Astronaut and you have the makings of a musical genious. Cant wait for the upcoming tour! Keep making music guys!"
2,"very good: This is a great cd. It takes a few times listening to it to start enjoying it,then it sounds like a new,but familiar lagwagon. This one was dedicated to Derrick Plourde, their original drummer that played the blistering drums on duh,trashed, and hoss. He committed suicide in 2005. This album is very well written,even though it only took them 2 weeks to write the songs. This album is definately up there in their top 5 albums."
2,"Bernie sings too !: Be sure, this is a nice CD from long years ago....but especially for elton john fans"
2,"Who said Bernie cant sing?: This is Bernie Taupin's second solo album and it is excellent.From the rockers Born on the fourth of July to his smooth ballads Venezuela and Love(the barren desert). This is a great album for anyone who has followed Elton and Bernie's career."
2,"Maximum Minimalist Soundscapes Unfold: If you like Math Rock/Instrumental Indie Rock i.e: Paul Newman, Tortoise, Don Cabellero, Dianogah, Triseza, Godspeed you Black Emperor than this is highly recommended. No Vocals just pure melodic builds and peaks. Really good deep Bass lines and fantastic drumming."
2,"In depth study: This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer."
2,"A Good Album: I have been a fan of Nightwish ever since I was first introduced to the amazing world of gothic rock/operatic rock music through Evanescence (if you like this band, then you may like this band). The first album of theirs I bought was their greatest hits album, ""Highest Hopes"". I have since been adding their previous albums to my ever-growing collection of gothic rock CD's. I am faithful to the Tarja days...not the newer singer. I believe ""Wishmaster"" is a good album and is an essential addition for fans of Nightwish, as well as the albums ""Once"", ""Oceanborn"" and ""Century Child"". I do love all of the songs from ""Wishmaster"" that are also found on ""Highest Hopes"". I can listen to this album straight through without skipping any songs. To me, however, ""Once"" is the ""Holy Grail"" of all the Nightwish albums,which would earn five stars...5.5 if it was possible."
1,"2/5: This album is 2 stars because some of the songs are listenable. I hardly enjoy listening to this album.I hardly recommend this album. Addy."
1,"Cheese enthroned: This is like a new genre of music - cheese metal, it sucks so bad that you don't even get angry with it, rather you feel sorry for the poor people in this god-awful band, and all the people who were misled into buying this or any other nightwish cd. The sound is like total cheesy motoristic rock with ridicules dickenson-like vocals distorted in the worst possible way...Ok if i had to pick one cd i would suggest you NOT to buy, this would come in second only to limp bizkit's chocolate starfish......."
1,"FORMULATIC AND HEARTLESS: THis band from Scandinavia reminds me of Stratovarius. They sound so clean, so perfect, that you almost forget they are playing rock. It's boring and flat sound, and the female singer is annoying with his boring voice. It's a totally forgetable experience."
2,"overated?!: I dont know how you can say this cd is overated, it is underated if anything. This is brilliant group of musicians, who all have talent on their insturments that really shines through and compliments the group as a whole. This cd overall is awesome, not a bad track from start to finish. My favorite part about this cd (being a guitar player) is the guitar solos, this guy really knows how to craft the perfect solo to compliment the track, unlike most metal guitarists who just try to play as fast as they can and end up killing the mood of the track. If your looking for a truly awesome melodic/power/prog metal experience look no further. \m/"
2,"A MUST HAVE: When I purchased this cd I had already listened to some songs on it and I liked them very much, so I bought the cd thinking that those were going to be the only ones on the cd that were good BUT when I bought the cd I could not belive how good each and every song was on the cd. Now I am one that likes bands like Cradle of Filth, Children of Bodom, Blind Guardian, Dark Tranquility, Iced Earth, Helloween,Iron Maiden, and let me tell you this cd is one of the best Ive heard and if you like good metal with good melody in it then this is most deffinitely a must have in your collection cd!!!!"
2,"Great: Insert the CD and listen to the first track. This is everything Nightwish is known for. Any fan will love this album"
2,"It all sounds the same, but...: It's all good. This album suffers from a common problem among metal albums in that almost all the songs sound very similar, but in this case it just doesn't matter because it's all enjoyable. From the haunting vocals to the masterful pacing of the instrumentals, every song on here is actually fairly inspiring to listen to, clich̩ as those descriptions sound. Definitely worth a buy."
2,"Great: Wishmaster is a fantastic album, that should grace everyone's music collection. Innovating and always refreshing. Truly a masterpiece."
2,"Spine Chilling, Awesome, and Grand!: I can not say enough about Nightwish, masterpeice in all meanings of the word. If I had to chose one CD to be stranded with on a desert island, this is it! All Nighwish is good but this is there greatest, and most epic. Tarja has the most amazing voice, and makes this metal in a catagory all it's own. You have just got to hear it, I can explain the way this album can make you feel. The classical of the future!"
2,"finlands power: one of finlands best kept secrets.this cd is full of power. tarja turunen vocals are just stunning.from the haunting song a dead boys poem to the powerfull she is my sin and crownless this cd is for any one who is into great euro metal a must."
2,"Very good, stunning !: The great differential in this metal band from Finland is the presence of a female singer. Other than this, the keyboarder writes all the songs, which is also unusual in a metal band. Because NIGHTWISH is metal, sheer European metal, but with style and precision. There's no great concern with fast guitar solos, just good music being played. But this CD shows clearly that they have evoluted. This is much better than "" ANGELS FALL FIRST""."
1,"L T: Very disappointed with this one .Try their CDs Dark Passion Play and Once .They get five stars from me ."
1,"interesting, but...: it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!"
2,"Wishmaster: I play this cd over and over again. I use this when I'm going for long walks and te time just fly!"
2,"Nightwish is unique and rocks for eva: Moi to you all,Nightwish est vraiment le plus cool des bands. Unqiue pis des tounes supers orginales, ca ma faite d̩couvrir le m̩tal pis aucune autre band ma faite vribrer comme eux. �� tous le monde cest un must buy."
2,"Nanci Griffiths ""Other Voices Other Rooms "" A great Video: I bought the album as soon as it was released in New Zealand after seeing Nanci on the Bob Dylan anniversary concert video singing ""Spanish Boots of Spanish Leather"". Apart from this video and the guest appearance with the Chieftans it was hard to obtain videos of Nanci in this country. I have most of her albums. This video is superb. The quality of the concert production is excellent. The background dialog gives you an appreciation of her background. The songs performed are not exactly as per the album which is a bonus as you get to appreciate other ways of producing the songs. The feeling that comes over is the commitment and honesty of Nanci. She communicates with her audience on an awesome level and this is translated into the viewer's experience. This video is a must for all Nanci fans and lovers of mainstream country.David Askew,Auckland, New Zealand"
2,"Please Release on DVD: This was a wonderful concert celebrating a landmark album from Nanci Griffith. The guest artists were superb. Please release on DVD !!"
2,"Welch Allyn thermometer: My health condition requires frequent monitoring of my temperature. The inexpensive thermometers were inconsistent and replacement batteries were hard to find. The Sure Temp Plus 690 costs more, but is very accurate, easy to use and AA batteries can be purchased anywhere. I feel confident in the readings. A back lit display would be nice, but is not essential. It probably would run down the batteries faster. I would recommend the item to anyone needing fast and accurate temp readings."
2,"Simple to use: I got one of these for our office. This model is a big step up from the previous model (679) that it replaced. The 679 has only 1 button from which to access all functions. The 690 has 3 buttons so you can quickly access the function that you want. It appears to be durable & accurate. Highly recommended."
2,"Peace of Mind: I love having this thermometer. We have three kids and one is an infant.I got rid of my pile of cheap thermometers! I don't have to second guess the reading like I did with the cheap ones. If you have an infant, you will need a rectal probe. I ended up buying that and switch them out depending on which kid we need to check. It's easy to switch out and I recommend spending the money to have that peace of mind."
2,"Just like the hospital and doc's clinic: I bought 3 other types of thermometers -temporal scan, auxuliary thermometer (but), oral thermometer, but was getting tired of guessing her temperature. I just decided to purchase this one, the same one used by my hospital and personal doc. So happy to have peace of mind."
1,"Awful. Too many typos to even read!!!!!!: With almost two dozen typos per page this version of Aron's Rod was completely unreadable. Not just typos but many of the sentences were incomplete. I found out to my frustration that it was too late to return the book. In frustration I simply threw the book away. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PUBLISHER. I wish someone would have warned me about this."
1,"Broke in less then a month: I bought this tent on 6/6/2005 for my 10 month old boy and used it once at the pool the rest of the time it sat in my dining room. I went to bed one night and it was up, but the next morning it was halfway down. When I went to see what was wrong I saw that one of the rods had snapped off in the metal holder and cannot be fixed. This could actually suffocate a baby if noone was in the room or the baby could hurt themselves if they found the broken rod. I was very disappointed because the size is great. I also agree with the other reviews it is hard to put together because the rods are so tight you have to have alot of strenth to get it set up. Please don't buy this we are going to return but it's such a hassle to spend 39.99 plus tax on something and it breaks in less then a month."
1,"rocket science: I cannot wait to return this item to Babies R Us. I tried to assemble it at home and the only thing I succeeded in was amusing my daughter. It's not easy to put together at all!"
1,"Not worth the money: I would not recommend this product.Tents are lots of fun for all kids, HOWEVER this tent is NOT just a pop-up tent. It take some time to set up and the poles are not durable or safe.My kids have used it for two days, and the wooden poles that hold up the tent split down the middle.I had to tape them back together and I, myself have gotten a deep splinter.For the amount of money I spent on this item I would have expected better quality.I would not recommend this product as a play item."
1,"BORING...: The information was worthwhile, but I found this video to be blah and boring. If you are going to bother to make a documentary at least make it somewhat entertaining! Add some interesting visuals and use a narrator that catches your attention. Read a book on this subject and by-pass this DVD."
2,"A Great Documentary: this documentary tells you the relationship of Lewis Carroll and Alice Liddle. and also tells how alice in wonderland was created. this was a very intersting documentary. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do"
1,"This may be a shortened version of ""Howlin' Wolf Live Gold"": This CD looks to be a 9 track version of the Howlin' Wolf Live Gold CD (Fine Tune 2212-2) which has 14 tracks and appears to be available through Amazon Marketplace (the first nine tracks are in identical order on both CD's). From listening to the samples on Amazon the sound quality of the 9 track CD appears to be the same since as the Fine Tune version. The Fine Tune audio quality is not all that good, may not really be live, but it is the Wolf, after all. Thought fair warning was in order."
2,"Such Great Music!: It took me forever to finally get this gem, but it was so worth the wait. Some of the best music I've ever heard. They had it all! Wouldn't it be great for them to get together again?! I just wonder if they really know just how good they were and how much they are missed."
2,"Great listening and worth every penny: John Townsend is the man with the voice, and it might be one of the finest vocal performances ever. If you don't believe it, just sit back and listen to this album from start to finish. The lyrics are interesting and fun and the performance is outstanding."
2,"When Will Another CD Be Released?: When you think of all the material that has been released out on CD. Why is this not available in North America. C'mon Warner!"
2,"A Winner!: One of my all-time favorites in a listening history that ranges from the Beatles and Motown in the 60's to the present. I can still listen to it over and over and over...It never gets old."
2,"Chris LaMach: Chris LaMach. Chris was my next door neighbor on 13th floor of Neumaier hall at Moorhead State University in 1977. Chris's favorite album was ""Smoke From a Distant Fire"" from the Sandford and Townsend Band. I listened to it so much when I was in college in Chris's room that I learned each one of the ten songs by heart. Try listening to the ending fugue of ""Squire James"" at 3 a.m. sometime when you've been up all night partying - it was enough to make you rethink your misspent youth. The lyrics of this album are sometimes repetitive and simplistic. For example, count the number of times the themes of smoke, fire, burning, etc. appear throughout the album. Also, the dreadful refrain of ""I've got ants in my pants and I just might dance all night"" in the otherwise terrific ""Shake It to the Right"" come to mind. But these are small criticisms. The bass line is dynamic, the vocals powerful and the songs are extremely catchy and long wearing. Just whatever happened to these guys?"
2,"good stuff: although there is actually only one hit on this CD, if youre from this time the memories are worth it all."
2,"A Classic.: Many thanks to Collector's Choice for reissuing this magnificent album on CD, previously only available on disc in the fine but expensive and rare Japanese pressing.""Smoke From A Distant Fire"" is one of a few dozen tunes that instantly, for those of us in our late 30s/early 40s, takes you back to the great days of AM gold. And, the good part, it's not the only catchy, likeable tune on the record.In a time when almost anything seems to qualify as ""a classic"", this duo and these tunes really are."
1,"NOT a review of the music -- just Amazon: iTunes has this exact album available for download on mp3 -- which means you don't have to wait for a CD and you can purchase individual selections. Sad to say that because I sooooo much prefer Amazon. They've been doing a great job in getting our oldies available to us... but need to do more... keep at it! I hope you think so as well."
2,"a good book: This technology module contains a brief introductory description to the exchanger type above, followed by information on construction, construction materials, operating limitsand principal applications. Where appropriate, a comparison is made with conventionalshell and tube heat exchangers to emphasise size and weight reductions that can beachieved by using compact heat exchangers.The Module 3 series present further information applicable to all technologies, such asgeneral advantages and limitations of compact exchanger designs, common applications,fouling and how to minimise it, energy efficiency. heat transfer enhancement, exchangerselection, specification and operation, process intensification and software programmes."
2,"Excellent Introduction: This, along withThe Witches' Goddess: The Feminine Principle of Divinity, provides and excellent introduction to Wiccan concepts of divinity. Both books are well researched and as complete as can be expected given the enormity of the subject."
2,"overall a good book.: Props to Will Connelly. I found it real researchable, very good to find, and overall the book I must find. I love it. It gives tips on rehearsing, what studio to built or to use, what type'a of equipment you must use or have, I mean it gives everything out from chapter to chapter.It also includes bibliography and recommendations you must read and know about. Good information."
2,"I love it: I just love PUR, they have great songs. I am glad that I could get them here in the US. I am German, so I do understand all the words, what makes a different too. Danke, PUR, fuer Eure grossartige Musik."
2,"Seiltanzertraum: If you have lived in Germany, you would have heard about PUR. Their music is catchy with great lyrics and very easy to listen to - even my children (young and do not speak German) love the music. You do not have to understand a word of German to enjoy this CD and any one of their CD's. Best track in my opinion on this CD has got to be "" Hor Gut Zu"""
2,"Not so hidden fantasies explored and discovered ...: Written by one of America's hottest contemporary erotica writers the author takes us on a real life tour of her private world of sex slaves, swinging and BDSM. In contrast to most readers pre conceived notions where the `sadism' part of BDSM lifestyle is usually a description of a master beating the living daylights out of his slave, Maria Isabel Pita describes her relationship with her master as a pretty well wholesome practice of living out her fantasies ......Yes there are rules and considerations to a good relationship and the results can only be understated as very very satisfying. Being a master erotica writer the author manages to describe her life in a manner that takes the reader on a delicious and vicarious trip into a world that generally are only deep and hidden fantasies of most women ....This real life exploration of a sex slave/master relationship make these fantasies not only seem more plausible but also delicious ....."
1,"Where was the editor?: Technically this was an exercise in tautology, and albeit the author admits that they are events not presented chronologically/linerally, the whole thing came off as a repetitive scrapbook of free associative ramblings. Cultural allusions were off and revealed just a shallow dip into areas of interest; just deep enough to create a character for a sexual fantasy.Every D/s relationship defines it's own perimeters, but this is the most silly top from the bottom (with a side of kink) i've ever read. Any girl who needs to prover her worth and devotion by degrading any and all around her isn't creating a deeper bond of submission, but pathetically wallowing in a misplaced sense of value (with a heaping side of self-image issues)."
1,"Like a train wreck, you want to look away, but you can't.: I picked up Beauty & Submission on a whim, after reading the back cover. I have recently begun to read a few BDSM and thought this book would help broaden my knowledge of the submissive aspect. I was disappointed with the outcome.I thought the book held more issues with jealousy and swinging than the day-to-day life of a lifestyle submissive. I also thought that the slave seemed to switch between a dominant/submissive role. There were quite a few references to watersports which were personally not my cup o' tea, as you might say.I did not enjoy all the pages where she ""quoted"" from her other novels. I believe the book would have been half the size if these would have been cut from the copy. It felt like an attempt to sell her other books."
2,"THE HARMONIOUS HOLLIES: This self-titled effort from the British band offers their masterful harmonies on an eleven track album.The trio of Allan Clarke, Tony Hicks and Terry Sylvester share most of the compositions, with the exception of the album's biggest hit, THE AIR THAT I BREATHE, written by Albert Hammond.The only real misstep is the obvious LONG COOL WOMAN clone, THE DAY CURLY BILLY SHOT DOWN CRAZY SAM MCGEE, which even copies LCW's opening guitar riff. However, the remaining tracks offer enjoyable examples of the Hollies vocal and musical expertise.In addition to the aforementioned AIR, I like the airy mystique of PICK UP THE PIECES, the harmonic rock of IT'S A SHAME IT'S A GAME, TRANSATLANTIC WESTBOUND JET, and DON'T LET ME DOWN. Ballad-wise, DON'T LET ME DOWN is sharp and the 50ish doo-wop sound of LOVE MAKES THE WORLD GO ROUND is a nice change of pace.Overall, an enjoyableslice of 70s pop."
2,"Listen to it more than once: I didn't think much of this album when I first got it and listened to it, but after a couple of listens, I really liked it. In fact, it's probably one of my favourite Hollies albums. I usually listen to my music on my ipod or my itunes on shuffle, and whenever I hear a Hollies song that I don't really know but I really like what I hear, it's usually from this album. So I would definitely recommend it even if you are not a hard-core Hollies fan!!"
2,"Pop power from 1974: Amazon's review is wrong; this 1974 LP often gets confused with their 1965 LP, mainly because they are both simply titled ""Hollies"". This one is the band's reunion LP with Allan Clarke, and is one of their best from the '70s, with delightful tunes such ""Falling Calling"" and ""Down on the Run"", both featuring harmonica. Why this LP only generated one hit, ""The Air that I Breathe"" is a mystery; everything here is equally commercial-sounding. Unfortunately, the happy atmosphere here was short-lived, as the albums that followed were workmanlike affairs, with a general lack of musical direction. No matter; The Hollies are one of the great pop bands, and this is one of their best moments."
1,"Beware of packaging: Sorry I know this is supposed to be a review of the item, but I want my complaint heard by anyone that might buy it. The hat itself is great, if you buy it at the store. New Era hats have large bills and a tall crown, but as long as you don't have a tiny head it will look fine. My complaint was that they shipped me this hat in a dvd box. Seriously. The hat was completely flattened, leaving two huge creases on either side of the logo. Ruined hat if you ask me, and will be returning immediately. You're probably better off buy this item in a hat store and spend the extra few dollars, at least they will have treated it right up to that point."
2,"Unlike the First: Celtic music has always been one of my favorite genres of music. After listening to Enam's first CD for years, I finally was able to listen to his second CD and was moved. His sophisticated touch to his songs have risen to another level and was taken by surprise. Compared to his first CD, his music has become more ""emotional"" and deep to the point that it reaches the heart. The varieties of instruments have not changed and the soundscape of his work is simply moving."
2,"Purple and Gold: I love this album. Just when you think you've heard everything in the Celtic meme, along comes a CD like this that is new and exciting."
1,"Ha Ha Ha: Why is she not famous? I agree with the other smart reviewer, because she STINKS! Wow does she stink! I had no choice but to throw her CD in the trash. I wasn't going to torture anyone by giving them this CD as a present! No way! I just THREW IT AWAY!"
2,"Essential Step in PE Preparation: This sample test provides the look and feel of the actual PE exam.Amazon, I love your company, but your price can't compete in this case (almost $200 as I write this). I purchased this same book on the NCEES website for a small fraction of the price you charge here (around $40 plus shipping)."
2,"Outdated - Does not match new test specificiations (April 2011): Please note that the format of the Chemical PE exam will change somewhat starting in April 2011. This sample exam is based on the old format that was used until October 2010. The problems are still helpful when practicing for the exam, but this book has no longer the same ""look and feel"" as the new exam. NCEES has a new sample exam book out that matches the new exam specifications and can be ordered from the NCEES website."
2,"Works like a charm: I bought a pair of these to replace similar hoses in my 5'er. The came on time, were well packaged, and work exactly as they should work. I had a tiny leak in one of the originals, and so replaced the pair. Very happy with the results."
1,"I couldn't get into it: I just coulAfter getting more than 50% through the book, I had to stop ... I just couldn't get into it and didn't like the writting style."
1,"Not complimentary.: This book really disappointed me. It seems like a narrative. No real plot just a rambling repetitive narration of a poor island child. I wish I could say I loved it....but felt really let down."
2,"Beautiful, Poetic, Distinctive Writing: I loved this book. This is the first Kincaid novel that I've read and I really dig the author's repetitive style of writing. I could definitely identify with the main theme of the book, having lost my own mother as a teenager. You go through life looking for that type of love, always coming up short because nothing comprable exists to the love of a mother who truly loves her children.You blindly search for womanhood, without the guidance from what could have been your most instrumental teacher. I would absolutely recommend this work to any young woman who has lost her mother, through death or otherwise. I cannot wait to get started on my next Kincaid novel."
2,"The autobiography of ""EVERY"" Caribbean mother.: Jamaica Kincaid's work always provokes sentiment for me. As a fellow Caribbean native, she describes some deep darks truths about people. . .truths that are consistent only among Caribs as they are influenced by thier social and cultural norms.In this novel, the mother's character, at parts, seemed much like my own mother: Having a dream of a better existence, but having it crushed by a woman whose dreams have also been diminished. And thus, a vicious cycle within a society of women who never seem to truly live; instead, only exist to raise other crushed little girls to yield even more unfulfilled woman.Don't look for any made-up or whimsical fantasies here. You will find yourself precisely where little secrets lie. . .in places you will only visit by way of Kincaid's chariot."
1,"Not my kind of read: I found the book to be uneasy reading. I am widely read, but try as I might, I had to quit reading about 1/2 way through."
1,"Disappointing: I had hoped to read a colorful story about life in the Caribbean, and was not expecting the story to be happy and uplifting. However, I was disappointed to discover that the most prevalent topics in the book were the character's bodily smells, excretions, and sex life. I was left wondering what these aspects of the book had to do with the character's mother."
1,"A fast, but mostly unpleasant read: This is the story of an unhappy woman who refuses to see or seek out any joy in her life. The overall feeling of the story is negative and depressing."
1,"Puzzling: After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"
1,"The autobiography of my mother: Did not really get lost in there book....found it boring....and I really wanted to stop reading it! But chose to painstakingly finish it.."
1,"The autobiography of my mother: It's not a book I'll ever read again. It was very boring. Glad I didn't pay that much. I give it a star."
1,"repetitive: This book has flowery language and the story line seems to have potential but the book never goes any where. I skimmed much of it, hoping it would develop plot and character, but it really never did. The plot and language were repetitive and didn't hold my attention. It seemed as though the author had a point she was trying hard to get to but it just never happened."
2,"Incredible: This is my favorite of Jamaica Kincaid's, which of course is saying a lot. It is simply amazing. More complex and involved than her usual writing, it is a ""hard"" read, but definitely worth it. Also, if you ever have a chance to hear her read, it is amazing, and you will never read her in the same way again."
1,"Too much self absorption: The author's intense focus on the main character's inner thoughts and feelings limits the reader's scope and prevents a broad view of the social environment of the book's setting. It was difficult to sustain an interest in the narrow range of concerns that surface in the exhausting detail flowing from the character's mind."
2,"a must read: this Book takes you on a journey for knowledge and understanding. it speaks to gaining something that is powerful that will be a stepping stone for better days and times ahead. this Book deals with expierences and coming to terms with life and how it has been dealt and the choices that you have to make.alot of issues and challenges are met head on and dealt with. very strong and well written book."
1,"Pseudo-nihilistic garbage. A waste of paper and ink.: What's the point here? It was never fully explicated, and the narrator does not inspire enough interest to carry this woefully inadequate plot - and I use that word loosely. Jamaica Kincaid needs to go back to domestic work"
1,"Do I have to give it a star?: Even that single star is more than this book is worth. My Engligh professor assigned this book to me during my sophomore year of college (along with Nectar in a Sieve, a far better, though not terrific book), and what little I remember of it was that it was just awful (and offal). Her writing is repetitive and choppy, perhaps descriptive but disgustingly so. Do we really need to know the ""wetness between [her] legs"", or that she cooked her menstrual fluid into some poor soul's dinner? I couldn't stand the book. If you want quality, read something by Neil Gaiman, or Stephen King (his descriptions of a girl coming of age in Carrie are much better than this book). Drop the book, throw it, burn it, whatever. It's just not worth reading. How many trees did we lose to its production (and, more importantly, how many talented young writers were rejected because this woman was published). It's just a book not worth reading about a story not worth telling."
1,"Sharks Walnut picture frame with emblem: I ordered this item for a Xmas gift, however when we put the picture in with the matting it did not fit, the frame and glass were crooked so picture did not fit. However you could not see this in looking at the product only when you tried to fit the picture and matting together in the frame.Very disappointed in this item and would not order anything made by the Memory Company again. I have also contacted the Memory Company who makes this frame to see what their response will be."
1,"Don't buy this book: Jean Giorno assigned rights to this story to the public domain. Unscrupulous, evil American publishers are acting contrary to the author's intent and prostituting this work by cracking down on English language versions (including online versions), even new translations from the French. Don't give your money to greed heads who are 180 degrees in conflict with the principles of this book."
2,"Poly tape: Does a great job highly visible. Works well with the different fencers that I use in the different pastures. Last a long time. Can't beat it for the price."
1,"disappointing, confusing, not an good intro to snmp: This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to ""refine the semantics"" of a ""data object"" and that ""it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII"". The author also notes that the ""ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex"". (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."
1,"This is a fuzzy description of SNMP: I read first edition of this book when it came. There were hardly any books available on SNMP at that time . Rose being one of the creators of SNMP, I expected this book to be good. And I was totally wrong! The descriptions are all fuzzy. After reading it, I had some idea about SNMP but I was not sure of anything I learnt. I think the RFCs on SNMP are best reading. They are precise and they do not leave you feeling uncertain."
1,"Reading an RFC is more fun and more informative too!: The editor and publisher of this book should be ashamed. It is an extended rant by the author that has no business being bound in hard cover. The Pine Mountain Group recommends excerps from this book to get up to speed with SNMP. I wonder who at PMG is friends with the author. This book will teach only members of the ""network management community"" anything. Anyone seeking entry into the network management community will need to find another door. By reading no more than 20 to 40 pages a day I managed to go through the entire book but I am afraid that I did not add anything to my understanding of SNMP that was not already there from studying for my MCSE. This book was a profound disappointment. It is at once dense, superficial, earnest, and sarcastic. The shame of it is that this author could educate profoundly if a good editor enforced some discipline or a co-author came in to help with communicating with those who are not the author's peers."
1,"Not just disappointed, angered.: It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames."
1,"Horrible for beginners; no comment as a reference: I am a developer with 8 years experience but novice to Network programming. A friend suggested this book as a first and default one to start with. I am completely disappointed. It's not a practical, jump-into it, internet-age book. Let me see if it serves any purpose as a reference. BTW, the CD is totally useless. It has only a few files which you can anyway download for free."
1,"Disappointing that Amazon's Price is 15.00 more than at B&N: Book has some interesting insight but does little to develop technical understanding. Is cheaper at B&N locally"
2,"The finale of the Icerigger series.: The finale of the Icerigger series does not have quite the adventure of the other two and harbors a pretty silly villain and plot. None-the-less, anyone reading Icerigger and Mission to Moulokin will have to read Deluge Drivers, if only to spend the last few minutes available with our new friends the Tran. There is definitely something wonderful and personal about this series. The characters are very rich and you really want to know more about them and share in their adventures."
2,"St. Rose of Lima: This is a great book for children doing research about Saints, especially particular Saints such as the first female saint of the Americas. A little pricey for the book, 6.00 would incld. ship would be a better purchase."
2,"Totally Cool blend of Rap vocal and funky jazz instrumental: A new wave. The strongest part that brings you back, is the creative flair of the music. The music can stand by itself. Just really cool, float me away."
2,"solid value: I might not want to nap on it myself, but my 2 year old loves it. Good quality and a fair price."
1,"poetic but excessive: I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels."
2,"Wonderful app: I love reading Essence magazine, I am happy I can now read it on my kindle fire. I recommend this"
2,"Very good: This is the only magazine I read regularly in college (25 years ago) that I still read now. Great articles on all kinds of issues and they do try to cater to black women from ages 20 to 55 or so which is not easy. Lately, it's been a little flat -- both in terms of magazine size and in the depth of the articles. I'm renewing it one more year and hope it improves during that time"
1,"Wolf in Sheep's Clothing!!!!!: I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Ever since Time Warner Publishing acquired Essence, it seems to be cantering to dark-skinned white women and NOT Black women."
2,"Essence: I love the magazine, but I would love to receive it before I see it on the news stands or at least the same day."
1,"WHERE IS THE MAGAZINE????????????????: I orderd this magazine in August... There should be some type of notation telling customers that it takes up to two months or more befoee the first issue will arrive.......What a waste of time. I could have gone to the library and received this magazine for free to read......I am still wating..... and there is no tracking number, therefore you just don't have a clear date for the arrival of the magazine.......not happy right now,,,,,,"
1,"where my copy: Cant rate something that I have yet to get a copy of. I feel like I calomst could have done better by going to the store and buying it. I have yet to get my first copy of the magazine"
1,"too many ads, not enough interesting material: i was hoping to gain some entertainment while reading things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention."
1,"Could Easily break a tooth: So disappointed with this product. Bought it online because I thought it would taste high end homemade. It is going out to the troops in Afghanistan and I wanted them to have a taste of home for the holidays . Unfortunately, I found I could've saved money and just bought Crunch N' Munch. This product has a bunch of un-popped kernels per bag; not randomly (which would also be bad) but at least 3 to 4 kernels per bag. I thought they would put their product through more rigorous standards of quality, but i see that is not a concern with this vendor."
1,"Zero Resolution: I'm sure I am one of a select few that do not appreciate a story that develops great characters and great sub-plots and then ends abruptly. It's almost as though the author got bored and quit - Zero resolution on anything. It doesn't leave me wanting more because I know the same feeling of ""What the Hell?"" will be waiting for me in the next book."
2,"Simply the Best!: I have adored Dean Konntz since I was in High school, I remember reading Phantoms for the first time and not sleeping through a night for a week! He is simply the best author I've ever found, he grabs you in the first page and doesn't let go until he's done what he wants to.I too was very Wary of the title, but I've found I'm not thinking about Frankenstein when I'm reading this, I'm just too engrossed in the characters! I can not wait until book two and I am so glad he wrote this instead of following through with making it a movie as he mentions in the begining of the book."
2,"like the critics say: RIVETING!: the book was great. i can't wait for the next one. definitely captivating."
2,"A Page-Turner Modern Day Frankenstein: Bought this book as someone loaned me the next two in the series. I read them all within 2 weeks because I needed to see what was coming next, and it was hard to put them down. I hope to hear more about Deucalion's ""adventures""."
1,"Ok but nothing great: Its not a bad book but I expected more. I didnt find myself locked into it waiting for the next thing to happen and unable to put it down. One thing I didnt like is the chapters are tiny. It doesnt really let you get into one part of the story before its switched to another. I think they did this to imply fast action and keep you always expecting the next thing but it didnt work for me. I wont buy the next book in the series."
1,"Dean Koontz's Frankenstein: I imagine this is a very creative book written by Dean Koontz, and I loved his Odd books. This book is just too dark for me, too brutal, too mean. I wanted to keep going, but there is no point in forcing my psyche to undergo things that make me too uncomfortable. Although it isn't for me, if you don't mind pretty dark books, you might like it."
2,"Excellent as always: I've been a fan of Mr Koontz for a long time. This book is on par with his best works and I'm hoping to read the rest of the series soon."
1,"Give me an ending: A decent story that gets you to turn the pages. The problem is, there aren't enough pages. The story just ends leaving you in the middle of an action sequence. I don't like paying $8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next one in a series. I don't mind series (thought I'm not that much into them), but each book in a series should stand alone."
1,"Disappointing!: The repetition of information and slow pace gave this book the feel of elementary school reading material. This series could have been condensed into one book and it would have been the better for it. I gave it two stars for the infrequent plot twists that got me through the book rather than throwing it away."
1,"It's Garbage.: Koontz can write. But he sucks as a story teller. Books are supposed to have a COMPLETE story in them, no? Well this one has no ending. No end at all. These 2 detectives are clued in to the fact that Dr Frankenstein exists, and is creating his ""perfect race"" to some day kill off all humans. That's it. You meet the original, now educated and ""at one with the universe"" Frankenstein's monster, you meet the main characters, and they have some conflict. That's the whole ""story"" in this book, which it really isn't because the basic elements of a story are a beginning, middle, and end."
1,"Just God Awful: Koontz turns the Frankenstein mythos into a cop story. The single, hot, emotionally distant cop...her laugh a minute partner who secretly loves her...the gruff rival detectives with questionable motives... No cliche is left unturned. The most interesting character...the first monster...gets the least ""screen time"". And the ending?This was just awful."
1,"Not Dean Koontz's best: This Frankenstein series started off with 3 1/2 stars and deteriorated downward with every new volume. Not up to Mr. Koontz's standard of edge of your seat, nail biting suspense I've come to love."
2,"This book is has inspired me: This book would probably have to be the best work of fiction I have ever read, and I have read a lot of fiction. Short chapters, follows all of the characters so you have every aspect of the story line. Very interesting and just up my ally, hits very close to home. I connect with Victor very much in some aspects. After reading this book, you almost want to start experimenting with reanimation, and see where it goes...or maybe thats just me. Very good book though."
2,"Stunning Craftmanship: Frankenstein: The Prodigal Son is one of Dean Koontz's best novels. It is fast-paced, full of action and suspense, and the characters are ones you become attached to. Definitely a page turner...I couldn't put it down. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves a suspenseful thriller. Warning: Once you've read this, you'll have to read #2...and if you liked it as much as I did, you'll probably end up angry that #3 isn't out yet. Can't wait!"
2,"Koontz nailed it!: I'd only read the first three Odd Thomas books of Koontz's, but thought I'd try Frankenstein, because the review on Amazon said it was not a rehash of the old tale. And, it wasn't. It's a refreshing twist on the resurfacing of the madman (he was never destroyed, and actually resents that Shelley woman's story), but with a clean dash of Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, a pinch of James Lee Burke's detective angle, all with a flavor of hi-test horror. I'm starting on Vol 2 tonight!"
2,"D Koontzs books: Was looking for the Frankenstein series. I found the first three books. they were brand new and arrived in good time."
1,"Frankenstein Prodigal Son: I am a big fan of Dean Koontz but not this book. The character Decaulion was boring. I didn't think much of the ending (I don't want to give it away). Usually I'm surprised by the ending, or satisfied. A predictable conclusion."
2,"Reviews, not plot summaries: This forum is for your opinion of the book, not for each of you to explain the plot over and over again. That's already done above."
1,"Don't bother: Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book."
1,"A good story but not great: I love Dean Koontz. This was not my favorite. In fact I was rather unhappy with the whole book. Now don't get me wrong he is a great writer but this book bored me. I don't read to get bored."
2,"A Frankenstein for our Generation: This is my first Dean Koontz novel and it will surely not be my last.Frankenstein, Book one: Prodigal Son is a refreshing tale of what happens when the man becomes the monster and the monster becomes the man. Mix that in with a few serial killers, clones and a unlikely partenrship. Think James Paterson meets Mary Shelly.Already on Book 2 can't wait to see what happens next."
2,"Gripping: I haven't been this taken with a book since the Harry Potter series. From the Prelude I was enthralled. Wonderful, strong characters and a storyline that makes putting the book down wrenching."
2,"I finished book one of Koontz`s Frankenstein.: I have to say, I'm a bit surprised it took me so long to get to this series, being the fan I am ... now im excited to have another great series ahead of me. A very convincing, modern take on the madness of Victor Frankenstein. Worth every minute."
1,"Neat package but very grainy indoor quality: Things I like...- price- sizeThing I didn't like and made me return- performance under regular indoor house lighting very grainy and considerably worse than my 8mm analog. Doing further research it appears this is likely not unique to Canon but common to DV camcorders. I am going to stick with my 8mm for a couple of years until DV tech improves since much of my use is indoors filming kids, etc."
1,"Horrible motor noise: Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it, so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it. I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera, but I figured I try it anyways. I bought it at Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy), and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise. You can't hear it while recording - it's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it. The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with. If I was recording something with no background noise (like my baby playing), then it was as loud as his voice! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound. We'll see..."
1,"always ""remove the tape"" message: I bought this model 18 months ago. Now it has big problem. I can't rewind the tape well. ""remove the tape"" mesasge always pop up. I sent it back to Canon for repair. They asked me $169 for repair. What can I say now? Too bad camcorder."
1,"Awful Company. Awful Product. Run! Run! Run!: Well where do I begin? After a month of use, the battery stopped working. Contacted Canon via email. They replied battery is not under warranty. Would you like to buy another one? Please.6 months later. I started transferring video to my computer only to find out this stupid camera eats tapes. I have lost two tapes so far. One of them was my son's birth!!!!The eating tapes issue is a major problem with this unit. They have known about it and continue to ignore it. Do a search on ""zr40 tape problems"" to see what I am talking about. There are even more results on sister product, zr10. I will never buy a product from Canon again. They are idiots for doing this to their customers."
1,"Zr40 Cannon: The camcorder was little dirty, and had a missing lens cover...Joanne did not have the missing cover and did not know why it was dirty...The power cord was defective...ordered a new one...Looked like it was chewed into...The case (cassette) compartment was slightly bent and unable to open at first...made some adjustments to it...Fred"
1,"Worst Product I have Owned: As many others have reported, this Zr40 began eating tapes with only a few hours of use on it. I have lost many precious moments recorded on tape because of the tape loading problem.The only good thing I can say about this camera is the bag was large enough to hold my Nikon P100. The Canon is going in the trash."
1,"Eats tapes: After about a year of use, ZR 40 started eating tapes. Do a google search on the topic, there are hundreds of people with the same problem. 'Remove Cassette' and 'Eject' (use those as keywords combined with 'Canon ZR' to view message boards postings) will appear on the screen, and that's the end of the toy."
1,"Sent mine back the next day: I just received my ZR 40 and really liked its size and low weight. But once I tried it, the fun was quickly over. Low light recording (in my apartment with lights on) was horrible and even with low-light mode selected, it was unacceptable. And in night mode, everything moves in slow motion. Overall, the quality was not that great, even in day-time shooting.I have a regular Sony Hi8 cam, and its low light and night capabilities are 100 times better. I would seriously hold out for a better camera, even if it costs a bit more.The image stabilization also makes the picture look strangely un-lifelike."
1,"Worked Great - eats tapes after some use: Like many who have found this camcorder, I liked the canon name and bought based on Canon and value. It was a mistake because I don't feel I should have already used up the life of this camera yet. If you go to several discussion groups you will see it has several issues with the deck, i.e. ""transport"". Just google zr20/40 etc. and ""eat tapes"". Suggest you try Sony or Panasonic."
1,"Not as pictured: The lights that I received are absolutely not as pictured. The product description is vague if not poor.The lights received are much smaller than in the photo (an inch in diameter). They are useless as illumination. I live in a high-sun area and have placed the charger in a position where it gets sun from dawn to dusk. The cord from the charger and the lights is long, which allows you to place the charger on the roof. In the end they are not worth the price."
2,"Great Music, and A Lot of It, At A Great Price: This disc contains Ornette Coleman's pioneering 37-minute 'Free Jazz' PLUS 40 minutes of shorter pieces recorded in the same year. So for a little less money than the American release of 'Free Jazz' you get about twice as much music, and the title track is the final piece, a fitting climax to a great set of music. That said, the jazz on this disc may be more challenging than some listeners would like, but among the extended collective improvisations of the sixties, besides being the first, this one is more immediately accessible, because it SWINGS and it COOKS! And you can tell the musicians are actively listening to each other and responding to each other's work, not just showing off or venting their emotions. So in a nutshell, 'Free Jazz' is less cosmic than Sun Ra's 'Magic City', less cerebral than Cecil Taylor, and less primal than Coltrane's 'Ascension', but probably more likely to hook you into an intensely brilliant musical world."
2,"This book revolutionized the way I look at myself: I finally understand why I've always felt different and like an outcast and I've learned to accept the things about me that are ""different."" I never knew so many things I thought were ""wrong"" with me were commonalities to being gifted. Now that I know, I recognize it in my friends and students and I finally have a structured way to improve how I communicate and interact with ""normal"" people. I highly recommend this book for anyone who's smart and feels like they don't fit in."
1,"Anesthesia for the gifted: I checked this book out of the public library in hopes of gaining some insight into the many kinds of difficulties an adult faces upon learning of his/her giftedness. Instead, this book was full of Oprah-like perky advice, sprinkled liberally with sleep-inducing anecdotes about ""Heather"" and ""James"" et cetera.The author does not have the gifted reader in mind with this book. It is overstuffed with fluff and not enough substance. I have yet to find a book on gifted adults that speaks to us at our own level of intellect and cogently outlines issues and strategies that we face with our unique brains."
1,"Mediocre: This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences. This is not the one.Check authors like Michael Gelb, Tony Buzan, Thomas Armstrong, Howard Gardner, and David Coleman. They have developed a ton of serious well researched materials and methods on this subject. They all provide far better stuff than this book."
1,"I was promised new!!: well, they promised me ""NEW"" but this book is far from being new. Marking all over the book means it's not new, the cover torn at some parts means that this isn't new!!"
2,"Good Product: Works great, looks more classy than the plain white ones for curtain hanging and it's strong enough to hold curtains. The end piece was a lot smaller than I thought. I thought it would be maybe 2.5 inches in diameter, but it's only about 1. (I didn't measure it.)"
1,"Absolute Garbage: There are plenty of tension rods out there. The _only_ advantage of the Umbra rods is that they look better. (Why other manufacturers haven't figured out the design part is anybody's guess.) The problem with the Umbra rods -- all of them -- is NO tension. I have tried these repeatedly.... Why? Because my local hardware store carries them, and they are readily available elsewhere, and I have opted for form over function. Every single Umbra rod I have used fails drastically. They simply cannot bear any weight. Or, to put it differently, they cannot exert enough force against the surfaces they extend out to for them to bear any load. Worse, the springs that are the key element in sustaining the tension tend to fail. When those springs fail, anything you have suspended by the rod will come down. If it's a lightweight drapery panel, you may be in luck. Otherwise, forget about it."
1,"Not exceptional: As other reviewers have stated, these curtain rods will not sustain much weight at all. They really aren't spring rods - you just twist it into place.I ordered 3 and they were so poorly packed that two of them were bent and completely unusable.I wouldn't bother with these, or buy them from Country Curtains because you can get an anchor so that they can hold more weight and be more stable. Of course, their $30 each instead of $19!!!!"
1,"shipped wrong color: I ordered three rods (all black) of various sizes and received free shipping. When the order was received, one of the rods was in pewter. They agreed to send a return shipping label for the incorrect item, but I would have to pay shipping on one rod."
2,"Dainty: This item is very beautiful and dainty, but a lot smaller than I thought. The stones could also be better, but the design is so catching that it makes up for it. I should also add that Charoite is a very hard stone to find at a good price, so if you are looking at affordable, this is it. Trust me, I spent several hours searching. Overall I really like this pendant."
2,"beautiful: I love this pendant. My only complaint was that the stone needs to be polished but, other than that, it's perfect. The design really stands out and I get compliments on it often. :)"
2,"Love it!: I am very happy with the weight and quality of this product. I wear this necklace often and love it!"
2,"good book for little ones: We loved this book! Anything that confirms what we are trying to teach is always great to find! This book teaches about gaurding your heart in a funny and cute way, but it shows the reality of what happens when we give in to temptation and watch things that we shouldn't! This book is GREAT!"
2,"Recommend for young musicians: This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional."
1,"Not for me.: Thought it was poorly written. The story was long & boring. Thought I would try her to find new writers. will not buy again."
2,"good fantasy romance: This book, though not ""great literature"", is a fun read, with plenty of romance and suspense. But you have to be willing to temporarily (for the duration of reading the book) believe in magic, including magical time travel, to let yourself get into the story. This book does have an engrossing, suspenseful story line in addition to the romance, so it is much better than those romance books that are simply an evolving romance held together by boring daily life events. I recommend it as good entertainment reading."
1,"Long and involved: Had a hard time following the story. Typos in dates really had me confused Malcolm was introduced in 1864 not 1964."
2,"a great cooooooooooooool album.: don't blive the random guy up there i have heard it it's have great songs and the d.j vir is very cool buy it and u 'll see ."
1,"Two thumbs down- I've never been more disapppointed: I've never been so disappointed with a CD!! If there were 3 songs on the CD that I liked it was a lot. And there are just some songs that should not be re-made by different artists- two in particular from this album is the Love song from the Titanic movie and Hopelessly Devoted To You. So I wouldn't even bother."
1,"The music is old and tired at this point.: The music has been out. What is the purpose of it? Forget it"
1,"It isn't a toy...: This is a decorative item that, although it's advertized as ""crystal,"" looks a great deal more like pressed glass. It does, however, come with ""lead content warnings"" so one must assume that it is, indeed, lead crystal. But don't expect sparkle -- the item is neither cut nor polished.It's small and pretty, and comes in a cheap plastic presentation case lined with flocked paper and Disney advertising. Still, what else are you going to give to a woman cast in the role?"
2,"beautiful!: Ai Yazawa does it again. Her gorgeous art makes this book great- for paradise kiss fans or anyone else who happens to open it. Yazawa is a creative genious and her fashion designs are beautiful, using the gothic lolita style that has become increasingly popular in the US. I suggest you read this book...if not for the awesome story, then for the even more awesome art."
1,"Just Unnecessary: As any fan of Nirvana is well aware, Kurt Cobain had a fear that was close to outright paranoia about Nirvana's music being milked and exploited to make a buck. All of a sudden, that fear seems totally legitimate.This is (basically) the 3rd ""Greatest Hits"" cd that's been released under the band's banner. Nirvana only had three studio released cds. Well ... four if you count 'Incesticide.'If you're a younger fan and you want a terrific introduction to the band's work save your money from cd and save up for the 'With the Lights Out' box-set. It doesn't cost too much and is a great way to break into the band.A true Nirvana fan understands that the only meaning behind this piece is dollar signs."
1,"Buy the box set instead of this!: All it is the summary of the boxset i guess for the budget nirvana fan? the reason i am giving it 2 stars all it had to offer was a track not included in the box set which is the come as you are demo.. the box set is alot more expensive but has alot more to offer than this and you get a decent dvd to watch all in all a buy for the hardcore nirvana fan... also the art work was originally picked out by Frances Bean Cobain and thats a good thing! other than that buy the box set"
1,"Poor value for money: I agree with most people that this is an un-necessary release. It is an obvious attempt to cash in by the holders of the rights. But on the other hand it is also a cheaper alternative to the 'With the lights out box'. I own the box and can honestly say it is definitely worth the extra money to buy that. This doesn't even offer the best of the box anyway, which it clear states in the title. I only bought this because I like to own anything and everything with the Nirvana name on it. I believe Nirvana are the most influencial band since the Beatles and any unheard recording of the bands I must have.Only hardcore fans will want to buy this, it only offers 3 previously unreleased recording of which only two are any good. 'Sappy' and a 1985 recorded version of 'Spank Thru' which surely must be the first ever recording by Nirvana.As far as value for money goes, this doesn't have anything to offer, sadly."
1,"Best of what box?: There is no excuse for the CD to be made. I thought when it was first announced it would be HIGHLIGHTS from the box set and a couple other songs they didn't put on the box. This CD is overburdened with scraps, there were great (full) songs on With The Lights Out, but only a couple of them show up here. Once again, the Cobain estate is going to try to sap us as much as possible until they give us a complete rareties, compilation and b-side tracks set. Buy the box set and make your own compilation."
1,"Smells like dollar signs...: Have you ever heard the song 'Milk It'? It was written for this exact reason. Or 'Rape Me'? ""Its so relieving to know that your leaving as soon as you get paid"" Francis farmer? You know when you buy this, some record exec is making a buck on a dead persons name. But hey we all know that suicide sells."
1,"A dreadful waste of cash: If this is the ""best of the box"" then thank God I didn't buy the box. Most of this stuff should never have left Cobain's closet."
1,"Nirvana Sliver Best Of The Box: As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs.on this release save the money and buy the whole box set it is worth it, except for Courtney being the Yoko Ono money whore that she is and saving these extra demo tracks for this cd instead of putting every last outake demo live etc on last years boxed set.so you have to buy this cd just for the 3 new tracks.I know Courtney has enough money so I would'nt buy this cd.Kurt should not be remembered this way with his widow milking every dollar she could get.I will make sure if I become famous that only my children would be in control of my music who would treat it with respect."
1,"Horrible CD: I bought this CD thinking it was a ""Best Of"" or ""greatest Hits"" type thing. It is far from that to be sure. Sure there are alot of songs here but they are all old demo's or just poorly recorded live stuff from garage practices & small clubs. Maybe I'm just too jaded, but the sound quality was horrible. I mean I was disapointed in it not being studio recordings in the 1st place. But in this day & age you should be able to go in & clean the really poor sound quality up a bit before packaging it up & selling it to the general public. It basicly sounds like it was recorded usuing a portable cassette tape player, & a cheap one at that! I'm gonna see if I can get some fool to actually give me some money for this piece of trash on Ebay, but I doubt it."
1,"Why keep on going with this crap?: It is more of the same, it is more of the one of the worst band that existed. Nirvana was never good, it was music for depressive people. Skip on this one that it is being release to fill the pockets of her stupid daughter and his stupid ex wife. Nirvana and Kurt Cobain were the most worst band of all times."
1,"Nirvana is awesome; but home demos of great songs played with terrible quality and instruments isn't: Although it does not mention it that the songs on the CD are demos in track listing, almost single song on this CD is cheap home made demos with terrible sound quality, with the exception of a few acoustic and live performances. If you want to buy Nirvana's greatest hits and enjoy the studio quality sounds and recordings of the ones of the best bands in alt rock history, this is not your album and do not be tricked like I was."
1,"Awful: Wish I had read the reviews first. I had no idea how bad the sound quality was before I bought this."
1,"Milk It: Some Of The Box: Four stars for the music, minus 2 stars for the concept. The review title represents exactly how I feel about this disc. One can't pretend that this disc is anything but a quest for more money, and some will agree with me that this doesn't even represent the box very well at all. This is one of those discs that, if you are a die-hard collector, you would buy, but most collectors already have the box anyway, so that makes you less likely to buy this one. Also, if you weren't a big fan and you bought the disc actually thinking it was the ""best"", it wouldn't give an accurate overview of the box and you'd probably become uninterested. So basically, if you must have the few extras, find it cheap or used, and if you're a first timer, let this be the last thing you add to your collection. It's been said a few times already, but just get the box and make your own comp. Why buy the milk when you can get the whole cow for...a little more?"
1,"Low Quality POS: I would have given it zero stars if possible. This is the worst cd I have ever listened to. The quality of the recordings are so bad that it hurts your ears to listen to it. This has the sound of the worst bootleg recordings I have ever heard. What a waste of money. This is the only cd that I have bought that I was actually unable to listen to. Talk about a sham by some corporate execs trying to make some money off of a dead guy."
1,"Completely Useless: I don't quite understand why Courtney is allowed to put these things out, and even more surprised that the other members agreed to it (since they have to). Everyone who already put out the 50 bucks for the box gets a whole three song bonus, songs which don't even sound like anything special. Nirvana was an awesome band who made some of the greatest music of all time, and this CD does reflect that. It's a good CD, but it's useless. It's nothing we don't already have. If they're going to put more Nirvana stuff out, it should at least be stuff we haven't heard. Just buy the three songs off of iTunes or something and save yourself the money from buying this CD."
1,"Horrible Quality: Even though the song list looks impressive, don't waste your money on this one. This is the poorest quality sound I've ever heard on a CD.Being a Nirvana Fan, I have other albums that sound great, but I can't recommend this one.Again don't waste your money."
1,"This doesnt deserve one star: What is happening here. First, a sub-par greatest hits album and then this sad best of the box. I love Nirvana but Courtney Love is really tampering with Kurt Cobains catalogue. The greatest hits should of had breed, polly, and verse chorus verse. Back to the box set now.This best of the box isn't even the best of!"
1,"I made better recordings in my garage: I was expecting a lot more when I bought this CD. I was expecting studio quality demos similar to Metallica's Garage Days. This CD is litterally a compilation of poorly mixed cassette tape recordings. Quality is very bad."
2,"who are you?: This CD is great for some people, but I think a lot of other people are buying it who maybe shouldn't.For the Nirvana fanatic with money, get the full boxed set, you will probably find the DVD and the book to be worth the extra money, even if you don't listen to the added tracks.If you aren't a fanatic, stick with the albums. You will not like the low sound quality of the recordings.Now, for the Nirvana fanatic who's a bit short on cash, but absolutely has to have ""Do Re Mi"" as part of his collection, that's who this is for. ""Do Re Mi"" is an excellent track, one of Nirvana's best...so if you are a serious Nirvana fan, you DO need to have that one."
1,"Totally F***ing Pointless!!!: F*** You, Geffen, F*** You Courtney Love!!!! Dave Grohl why didn't you STOP THEM, YOU WERE MY HERO... WHAT HAPPENED DAVE????? My God, it has come to this..."
1,"Uhh yea right: I downloaded it for free courtny, then i kept the new songs then deleted the rest..thank for this waster of plastic tho.."
1,"Good job Courtney...: Releasing a Box set, then a year later releasing a CD containing mostly Box Set songs and then three new ones, hoping the hardcore fans will buy both to get the full list of songs. It's a shame.She said she is bringing Francis Bean into the ""family business""- the family business of milking all the money you can of your husband's music? That's low Courtney, even for you."
1,"Tasteless Trash: If I could give this half of a star I would. I am a big fan of Nirvana, but this was a total disappointment to me. The tracks sounded awful. I felt like I was ripped off in every sense of the way. I took it to a buy-trade-sell place and not even they would offer me anything for it, which shows you the poor quality of this album. A word of advice; DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"
1,"Listen to the samples before you buy: Okay, I made a HUGE mistake. I was at Best Buy (no on-line reviews...) and bought this CD based on the song list. Listen to the samples before you buy, you'll be convinced that YOU TOO, can be a ROCK STAR. I wouldn't buy an album that had me singing on it, but Kurt sounds weirdly like my own crooning in the first track. OOO, OWWW, MAKE HIM STOP...."
1,"Unnessecary Garbage: Recently, Nirvana released the amazing ""With The Lights Out"" box set. Truly, a definitive Nirvana collection.Now they have released this compilation, Silver: The Best Of The Box. All the songs on the record can be found on With The Lights Out ANYWAY, and they didn't even pick the most notable songs from the set anyhow.If you should buy this, you should only be a DIE HARD Nirvana fan, who only buys this on principal."
1,"Very Low Quality Recordings: Nirvana should be ashamed of having this released. If it's the best of the box then the rest of the box must be overdriven drunken slobbering screams accompanied by smashing guitars and kicking drums. If you like unprofessional recordings you will love these. My guess is these were recovered from the trash somewhere to make a quick buck. Although if they are demos it's a wonder Nirvana got anywhere."
1,"2pac of rock is back!: I own the boxset of Nirvana and its good. It took awhile to come out, but it was worth it. Now this? A cd that takes the best moments from the box and adds three new tracks? How much more will fans have to suffer? Whats next for fans? Kurt's legacy is like 2Pac and being crapped on but his greedy friends and family. I cant wait for Scott Stapp to produce the next Nirvana ""lost cd""!"
1,"HORRIBLE: ok--first of all, saying that this CD is the ""best"" of anything is completely wrong, and don't give me that Bullsh*t about ""you try to write something"" thats not the issue. the issue is the fact that this CD contains Horrible quality tracks that someone who put 200$ into some mics could top. Nirana rocks, but this cd blows.Thx courtney, now go do some blow."
2,"Screw you Doug the ""guitar player"": Bloody hell man, are damn stupid, Nirvana were an amazing band. Just because Kurt played simple stuff on the guitar, hey man, I'd really like to see you come up with something as good as that, it ain't in the technicality piss head, it's in the bloody soul, Kurt had soul (an unhappy one, but a soul). You are a bloody souless creature who deserves nothing less than to go to hell. I play guitar and I respect Kurt Cobain for doing what he did. His music had so much feeling and emotion, I don't know what kind of music you like, why don't you bloody well tell me! I like beer, and Nirvana goes very well with beer, try it, you serpentine monster! I am Bonzo, and I love Nora more than anything in this world!"
1,"$ Scam: The songs on Sliver are easily some of the best of the box but the completely ignored some of the best, also. Its said for me to watch the ""Nirvana Corp."" aka Courtney Love to do something like this. Ultimately, if you don't realize that this is a shtik for $ then you must be confused. Nirvana released a best of cd and then a best of the box? Im just guessing but i think this is what the record company was saying:""We'll throw a couple new songs on it and we'll get some true fans to buy it just to have it.""It's been released for the cash. And this is something I know Kurt wouldnt have approved of. Hopefully someone takes this into consideration before buying it. yea,its good for the collection but its sad to see this is happening. I bought it for the cover art and stuff just to have for the collection nothing more. If your looking for some music get the actual box set."
1,"Don't Buy: This is the worst recording of Nirvana I have ever heard! The entire thing sounds horrible. DON'BUY IT!!"
1,"Thought I was missing more than this...: I don't own the box set but, if this is the best of the box then I'm not missing much. I really like Nirvana but there really just aren't many winners here especially since this is suppose to be the pick of the litter from ""With the lights out"".There are a few solid tracks here but I just expected more..."
1,"Very easy to solve!: This puzzle is very easy to solve, I would not recommend it for anyone. Buy the ""original"" ""Don't Break the Bottle"", it will keep you entertained much longer."
2,"Great gift to pass on!: Gave this to a friend in October.... they finally solved it in Dec when her relatives came to visit.... the Univ of Virginia student solved it! She will pass it on to our other friends for their birthdays...Really like the game, its made well and it is harder than you think. I actually had to get my William and Mary graduate to put it together! I also gave one to my Mom for Christmas, who has not solved it yet. She will pass it on to her ladies she plays cards with. Its fun and different....a good conversation piece!"
2,"Synopsis: Dr. Ivie is in Italy looking for a beetle. Unfortunately, the beetle he seeks was only found one time by one person thirty years ago in one hole in the ground, and it's only about a millimeter long. While the graduate students dig and all sift through mud, dream sequences, animation, and stock footage open a window into the obsession and passion that drives these impossible tasks of science. The ""science"" of clear and instant results is dissolved to reveal the reality where methods are bizarre and failure is not only common, but just another step in the process."
1,"Really bad....: This is by far the worst movie in black cinema. Take everything you liked about ""Friday"", ""Booty Call"" and ""CB4"", leave them out of this movie and this is what you get. 90 minutes of [stuff]. It is low budget beyond low budget, and you get a headache from listing to fake, incoherent characters who look like they were picked off the street of some ghetto. And those who like to see booty-there is basically none, just one scene which lasts about 15 seconds and features a silent, unattractive ""dancer"".. If you are a fan of these movies, rent it first, you'll see. If you buy it, you will find a movie devoid of beautifull black women and good looking guys, but which is filled with stupid humor and a story which will put you to sleep."
1,"Stupid: I must admit, it was terrible. I hate to admit i liked it. I guess it was so STUPID, you couldn't help it."
1,"Stinks like stale cabbage!: This movie is bad, Bad, BAD! Makes Rudy Ray Moore look like Fellini!Essentially, this is the crude ""story"" of a college football player who goes down to Daytona with his friends for Black Spring break and hopes to sing with the pros. Problem is: outrageously bad acting, corny ""humor,"" strong and unecessary reverse racism (the lone geeky White character is constantly referred to as a ""cracker,"") vile sexism, unappealing characters. etc. etc.Get this video only if your fireplace runs low this winter."
2,"Palabras de aliento para tu caminar con Dios: Una vez mas Charles Swindoll llega al coraz�_n del cristiano como tu y como yo.

2,"great book - both down to earth and inspiring: Good for beginners or for those already on a spiritual path - as always another perspective gives you insights in areas you may have thought you had it all sussed or confirms something you had not quite got your head around yet. Forgiving and generous - a book to come back to."
2,"Boot Camp to Spiritual Fitness: This book is definitely an ""In Your Face"" program. Each chapter presents full frontal examination of your Spirituality.Unless you do the exercises at the end of each chapter, you are missing the full benefit of the book.I highly recommend you use this book in a class or at least working with one other person to discuss what comes up for you."
2,"Spiritual Fitness: Loved this book; I have read it, taught 2 classes from it and it has transformed my life and the lives of my students. \I highly recommend this book and Her TAPES to anyone and everyone interested in spiritual growth.Rev.JudyCockeysville, Maryland"
2,"Awesome guide for the experienced mountaineer: This book outlines hundreds of different routes up all of the Wind's well-known peaks (as well as several not-so-well-know ones). He did a phenomenal job amassing all of this information. There is enough here for a short lifetime of awesome mountain trekking.The information Kelsey gives is mean, lean, and straight to the point. Novices beware, this book makes no attempts to come down to anyone's level. It is written for those grounded in that arts of route-finding, technical climbing, and alpine survival. It is not a hiking book. If you are uncomfortable with this, either buy a more toned-down Wind River guide, or pick up a book to build your skills like ""Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills"" and start psyching yourself up for some world class backcountry."
1,"Too broad and too liitle info: Not knowing Wind River the guide really did very little to help plan a trip excpet for forming a general idea of where to go and what to see and climb. On this level it fulfilled it's job, but I was hoping for much more."
1,"E.A.'s reveiw: I bought this book for my book club and I have had a very hard time reading it. The characters are too life-like in my opinion for me to have any sympathy towards them. I have read other novels from the Victorian Period that I have liked, but this one seems overly wordy and dull in my opinion. I gave two stars instead of one for the mini novel Indian Summer of a Forsyte, the best part of the series, which saved this from a one star reveiw. It was touching and beautiful to read. If only the rest of the books followed such a formula."
2,"Long but interesting: I got interested in reading this book after viewing the Masterpiece Theater showing of the Forsyte Saga. It was interesting to compare the movie's interpretation of the book, and it gave a little more insight into the motivations of each of the characters. Overall a good book."
1,"good story, overdetailed writing: Having first viewed the TV version of this story, I find that the written version tends to be overlong and overdetailed. (I am not that interested in the brand of cigars that old Jolyon smokes.) I am only about 1 1/2 chapters into the book and hope it gets livlier soon."
2,"The Best Book I have read in years: I was bored one night and picked up this book that had been on the shelf for probably 20 years. Oh my goodness -- if you love Jane Austen and England, you will love this book. I could not put it down. The characters -- although numerous and many with the same Christian names! -- are kept distinct and are extremely vividly drawn. One realizes how the social sanctions of the day kept people in their place -- just the discussion of what divorce did to a family alone is worth its weight in understanding how social mores have changed. I thought I would be bored stiff and came away 4 days later after finishing this book wanting to start the next one, 700 pages and all. Enjoy!"
2,"Rancid Crank Out Another Classic...: Rancid's new CD is nothing like Life Won't, but that whole ska thing was getting old anyway. This album on the other hand is dripping with mad punk rock aggression that doesn't even give the listener a chance to breath inbetweeen songs. Almost every track on here is good, but gritty songs like ""Poison"" and ""Its Quite Alright"" stand out the most. Rancid 2000 is a true punk rock classic."
1,"Marginal: This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW."
2,"hard topic but well worth the knowledge: Ms Too has tackled a subject that is immensely difficult to learn. However, I thought her approach and explaination was excellent. Readers, please be patient and reread each section more than once.Again, advance Feng Shui puts alot of people in despair due to the topic but once you master the knowledge, the wisdom and flow will pour forth clearly."
1,"How Annoying! Total waste of money: I bought this book planning on checking the Feng Shui for my house for the year 2002 and find out after reading several chapters that Lillian Too assumes your house was built since 1984 or has had major renovation during this period. If this is not the case then the rest of the book (i.e. the most important part) is totally useless. Buy another book, any book except this one."
2,"A great collection of songs on this karaoke disc: 1. The Winner Takes It All - ABBA2. Dancing Queen - ABBA3. Waterloo - ABBA4. Take A Chance On Me - ABBA5. Fernando - ABBA6.

1,"Cable is a cable is a cable: Buying a Sony cable wasn't worth it. I could have spent less buying any 4pin to 4pin 1394 firewire cable. Search around. Buying name brand may not be worth it."
1,"Not HAPPY: I purchased this for my sony camcorder. I have windows XP on my laptop and this cable does not work. My laptop does not even detect my camcorder when attached.............Its a waste according to me"
1,"Sony I. Link 4Pin Digital Video Cable: I ordered the Sony 4Pin to 4Pin Digital Video cable for my Sony digital camcorder and it came with a bent pin in one of the connectors. I specifically ordered the Sony rather than a generic one because I thought it would be more likely to be of higher quality. It was advertised as new. When I plugged it into my camcorder it did not work. On examining it I found that it had a bent pin. When I looked at the camcorder connection I found that the bent pen had ruined the connection in the camcorder. What a bummer. I contacted the seller and they were willing to send me a replacement for the cable but took no responsibility for the defective one ruining the camcorder connection. I did not bother to get another one for obvious reasons."
2,"Great for video transfer!: Atlast I can transfer my videos from my HC32 Sony camcorder to my laptop! Works with Toshiba & Dell laptops, not sure about others. The iLink/IEEE 1394 port on Toshiba is also called S400."

2,"Has to be one of the best books on salvation ever written!!!: Dr. Lewis Sperry Chafer was used by the Lord as a champion of grace. And I have no doubt that this continues even today....long after Dr. Chafer has gone to be with the Lord. I recommend this book both to unbeliever and believer alike. I have never read a more comprehensive book explaining the marvelous salvation that God offers the whole world through simple faith in Jesus Christ!!!"
2,"Blows Toxic Avenger I away: For those of you who liked TA 1, you've got to get this one. If you thought the first one was funny, then this one is gonna have you rolling on the floor. Imagine the King of Porn, Ron Jeremy, playing a priest--well, he does in this one. That irony is funny enough, but there are are TONS of other funny sh*t in this flick. This movie is non-stop from the get-go. If you like all the Troma goodies--gore, outrageousness, gratuitous nudity, a little bit of lesbo action, and over-the-top comedy--then this movie is a MUST for your collection. You don't just have to be a Troma fan to like this movie. Like I said, if you like all of the things listed above, then you should get this flick. Trust me, you won't be sorry. Just don't watch it with your grandmother or little ones."
2,"Movies I Own U Should 2!!!!!!!!!!!: Toxie at his best this is one of the greastest TROMA movies ever made I would gladly pay 30 dollars for a movie this good also get the Tox Box***** and the Toxic Crusaders***** It's the cartoon show from when I was kid It's FRESH as HELL. The extra features are great like always with TROMA, you also get a cool Citizen Toxie poster!"
2,"Brilliant: TOXIC AVENGER 4 IS AN AMAZING MOVIE. hillarious and filled with violence the DVD is packed with extras including 3 commentaries deleted scenes and a full lengtht documentary on the making of toxie 4 . The best Toxic avenger movie gets one of the best dvd of the past year."
2,"A NEW ASSKICKING MOVIE MADE BY LLOYD: this movie whas relly great.the movie is much action in it much fighting.and its hilarius very good movie.the director lloyd kaufman did it again a new toxic avenger movie that gets a 9/10this movie isnt just one dvd its 2 dvd with one special feature with an including 95 minute dokumentary""apocalypse soon!""and much more special features.i got this movie as a present.you should go to the nearest store and buy this DVD.CITIZEN TOXIE:THE TOXIC AVENGER IV."
2,"good lord - i cant see how it gets any better than this!: its entirely beyond me how with every film lloyd kaufmann directs, it outdoes the last. sheer genius.this is one of THE greatest flicks ive ever seen in my entire life. with hours upon hours of dvd extras, this two-disc set is the greatest dvd since terror firmer. i cant even begin to describe how amazing this movie is. indeed it is the true sequel (although toxic avenger II is a guilty pleasure of mine).i think the most amazing thing about this movie is it was made with 1 half of 1 percent of the amount of money a common hollywood film costs. utter and sheer genius."
1,"BEYOND OFFENSIVE!: If you love, care, like, or even have the smallest amount of respect for yourself or another person don't expose them to this garbage! I did not expect a movie with taste, and I enjoy B-movies, tacky gross outs, and off color humor. BUT THIS MOVIE GOES WAY OVERBOARD! The filmakers trying so hard to be shocking they forget to give this flick anything that a decent human being could find enjoyable."
1,"One of the lesser Louis L'Amour novels: I've read them all, many times over and am a big fan. This one held so much promise for me, describing the culture and life of the Californios. And then he had to inject that mystic story of another world in there....."
2,"California History/Mystery All In One!: This one doesn't really fall into the Western category, but it's full of hammering action, informative local California history, and mystic goings-on. Seacoast adventures, early Califronia ranching, great good-guys and really bad bad-guys, and mysterious appearances by silent, unknown characters fill this one to the brim! Best of all, L'Amour introduces in this story, for what I believe was the first time in his writings, the famous ""portal to the other side,"" which really sets this story apart from almost all of his other works. Excellent yarn through and through. You won't forget it for a long time after you first read it!"
2,"Good choice for light duty homeowners: I bought this since the big MK I also use was too heavy and messy to take into condos. I rehab ocean condos and lug all my tools into the condo for 2-3 months (compressor, table saw, router table, etc). So I focus on portability first.However, the instructions were limited, the arbor allows the blade to not spin true, and the setup screws will be quickly lost after unpacking.But strangely - the saw and fence quickly cut straight after you allow for the width of the blade wobble. Angles require some extra work. I used a 7"" speed square against the fence for diagonal cuts. I haven't tried the 1.3"" cutting depth yet. It should do it. But for how long? I don't see it as a long term contractor grade saw but as a saw that can be used for 2-3 yrs with about 2-3 jobs per year."
1,"Poor support from Plasplugs: About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."
1,"Don't waste your time or money on this: First the good things. It cuts through ceramic tile easily and I actually had good success using the 45 degree cutting feature, although, it's a little sloppy.Now for the bad. I had problems similar to previous readers:The fence had to be modified to fit, it is very difficult to adjust, it is not accurate (you will need to use a tape measure), and the fence stripped out after about 10 cuts so it could no longer clamp to the table.This made it effectively USELESS for accurate cutting, so my day of tiling was wasted. Oh, and tiles catch on rear blade gaurd.I am now going to try and return the saw."
1,"Not very good: I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."
1,"Spend your money elsewhere...: You could do a lot better for the price of this tool. Comparing it to comprable models costing half as much? I recommend spending for the cheaper models or springing for something better. The blade wouldn't align with the blade guard until I modified the table with a file. The tightening bolt that runs through the fence stripped in less than two weeks of light use. (Trust me, I'm not THAT strong.) Spend less or spend more, just don't bother to spend for this tool. One additional note: I contacted the manufacturer about the stripped rip fence and they promptly sent me a replacement without questions. I suppose that's worth an upgrade to 2 1/2 stars. I still think one could do better for the money. Oh, and my saw leaks water continuously when the unit is operating. Better leave it at two stars afterall."
1,"Plasplug is JUNK!!: By something else. This is the worst piece of machinery I have ever bought. Virtually impossible to cut any size tile on the diagonal. Typical imported junk!!!!!"
1,"Not recommended: I have to agree with most of the reviews here. This saw is a peice of junk. I returned it almost immediatey. What a waste of time! I should have read the reviews here first!"
1,"Very poor: This is a very good concept, but poorly executed. On my particular saw, the tilt section of the table didn't fit flush, so it made the right side of the table useless. Once raised to the 45 degree position, the tilt section was wobbly, as one of the flimsy plastic props did not even touch its rest. The blade ran neither true nor parallel to the fence. The blade retaining nut had to be tightened about every 10 cuts. The blade actually flew off the shaft a couple of times. The tile caught on the plastic end caps of the fence, which stick out. I could easily stall the motor with ordinary 1/4 inch ceramic tile. Can't remember all the other thigs wrong with it, I was in too much of a hurry to return it."
1,"Buy Something Else!: The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good."
1,"PlasPlug Master Tile Cutter: Bought at Home Depot for $199. It is a toy, not suitable for serious work. Flimsy contruction, difficult or impossible to adjust. Recommend getting a brand name."
1,"spend the additional money and get an MK: My main complaint is the fence, getting both sides square to the blade and locked down will take you about five minute's and even then don't put to much pressure on the fence as it will ether bow or one side will move. An MK is much faster put the tile on the carriage push the tile to the blade make sure the kurf is going to be on the correct side of your mark slide the carriage back set the fence (if you'd like) turn the saw on and cut. I renovate older home and many times the walls are out of square so your cut tiles are going to be getting bigger or smaller as you go God help you if you get into this position with the Plasplugs tile saw...."
1,"Bad fence, Bad tilt: The rail keeps popping up, so the plastic endcaps are no longer flush with the table. I had to file them down so the tile won't get caught. The tilting table will move apart at the hinge when I start pushing the tile through the blade, it is just useless. Straight cuts seemed to work OK. This may be suitable for small around the house jobs. I think the design is from England. Bad British engineering !!"
1,"Made Me Feel Worse!: A friend suggested this herb to me to help with my awful PMS. After taking Vitex for only three days during PMS, I began to feel horrible: very irritable, nauseous and foggy. After doing some research, I found that a percentage of women react very negatively to this herb -- some people remarked that they initially felt better, but then progressively felt worse and thought they were going crazy; some said they immediately felt terrible. I guess it's a gamble that many of us are willing to take to feel better though. Wish it had worked!"
1,"Not one change: I have been taking two capsules daily for two months and not felt or seen one difference in my health. This hasn't been the miracle pill to help cure my PCOS or help my ovulate. In fact, I had a period before I started this pill and not one since."
1,"made my head spin: this made me really dizzy so I had to stop using it after only one use. I ended up tossing it out."
1,"Didn't help: I found research that said this possibly may help get your cycles back and so after finishing the bottle the cycle never came. I guess if you keep it up after a few months is what might help, but I decided instead of buying more and hoping it would help to talk to my doctor first."
2,"Vitex: This product was great , smells weird but it is a root. I would buy it again, no side effects. Great service and price."
2,"It's Working...: My husband and I have been TTC for 2 yrs with no luck (yet) so after much research I decided to order Vitex. My cycles were anywhere between 35-40 days and I had little to no CM. I took it as directed last month and noticed 100% improvement in my CM and I ovulated on day 15 which is unheard of for me! So far, this cycle seems to be identical to last month which is awesome! I haven't gotten a BFP yet but it has helped regulate my cycle!"
1,"Caused tiredness and confusion: I noticed I was very tired and headachy after taking Vitex, but I read that is a common side effect and that it was temporary. After the first week, I only noticed the tiredness increasing. I would feel almost confused at times and just plain strange. When taking it during the day, one time, I completely drove past the shopping center I was going to. I'd go through these spells where I felt very heady, like I was going to pass out. I was only taking 250mg per day. I had high hopes for this as a treatment for PCOS, but I couldn't continue with it. This doesn't seem like a common result, but malaise and confusion are listed among vitex's side effects. Maybe I should have tried vitex fruit which is less potent than vitex extract, but this is something I'm not messing around with any more! Back to progesterone cream!"
2,"Worked like a CHARM!: I do not write reviews typically but this product changed my life! My periods have always been irregular, however I still did not expect them to just stop when I was 25.. I suffered the mental agony of never getting periods unless I took Provera when I decided enough was enough. The wise Internet came to my rescue and convinced me that Vitex could be the solution. I started taking this product once a day (first thing in the morning) for 120 days (2 boxes) with a gap of 2 days when I forgot to pack it on a business trip. During those 120 days, I got 5 periods (spotting, very light to light flow). Then I decided to give myself a week's break... and got my full fledged period. So, so thankful! If your doctor says everything's okay with you (yeah, right) BUT you just need Provera to get your period and fertility treatments to have children, I HIGHLY recommend you try this product. Just give it time to work. Good luck!"
2,"Excellent use of Humor to teach Finance: Robert Cooke use humor throughout the book to help nonfinancial manager understand financial reports. The use of the Spouse House Firm throughout the book allows you to see the develop of financial reports as they apply to a small growing firm. Robert writes as he is right in front of you talking to someone he has known for a long time. He uses humor to help you understand the difficult concepts of the book. If you are looking to learn financial statements or just refresh your skills this is the book I recommend."
1,"zero stars - an absolute horror: This is the 2nd CD that I've purchased of rerecorded versions of Monty's 60s songs. This record label is crooked for putting a 60s photo of Monty on a CD that was clearly recorded in the 80s or 90s. Abysmal. Shameful. Vile. Criminal. An Abomination."
1,"Dissapointing: I purchased this product to help eliminate my mild acne, and used it in conjunction with MDSkincare's cleanser/toner, and tinted moisturizer. I have 4 days left of my 30 day supply and have seen no improvement in my acne, or noticable improvement in overall skintone. Actually, I am now breaking out in places I've never had probelms with before. I will try Perricone products next, the MDScincare pads seemed to be a waste of $75 for me."
2,"Fantastic: Love this product, makes my skin look and feel great! It's easy to use, no mess no fuss. I don't use it everyday because I like to save it for the weekends because it makes my skin feel so good."
2,"Best Product I have EVER purchased: It takes alot for me to feel the urge to write a review on anything. I have very sensitive skin (so many things irritate it) and I also have dry skin. Recently I was having skin problems with my forehead (tiny little bumps under the skin). Nothing helped - even a prescription from the derm. When I used this peel literally within an hour I noticed a difference in my skin (not kidding). The little bumps seemed to lessen and my dry skin became smooth. I was afraid to use this product every day (bc of my sensitive skin) but so far I have had no problems at all. My skin looks so much better. No longer dry, tiny bumps pretty much gone, and tone looks better.I use it at night though instead of the morning. Kind of makes the skin a tad sticky."
1,"Totally trashed my skin!: I bought this at Ulta after doing some research regarding chemical peels helping acne, and one of the sales associates recommended this product. My acne has always been pretty mild, but I wanted to see if I could get it under control better. My skin is extremely delicate. My skin actually felt great for the first few days of using this product -- balanced out my skin tone very nicely. Perhaps I should've stopped there, as after a week I broke out with HORRIBLE deep, cystic, painful acne that took me weeks to get over. The scars/pock marks they left behind were even worse. I would be wary if you have sensitive skin. Fortunately, the folks at Ulta remembered me from a few weeks prior and refunded my money. Sadly, I did almost no explaining as my face told the whole story."
1,"Not for everyone's skin!: I bought this in hopes to reduce some small bumps on my cheeks and even out my skin tone. What I got was horrible acne and sores all over my face. The very next morning after using it I woke up with zits on my face! I haven't had acne since I was a teenager. My first thought was, it must be cleaning out the pores, thus the breakout, but after three weeks of using it every other day, my face is covered in sores that won't heal! I don't want to say it's a bad product, because it obviously works for most of the people that have written reviews, but my experience has not been good. I will never use it again. I'm just glad I got it on sale for $45. C'est la vie."
2,"Less one star due to price: I was surprised that after a few days use one really can tell a change in pore size without the harshness of an astringent. This is a real quick & easy effective non-irritating skin program to follow. I wish it came in much larger sizes to bring the price point down. The cost is the only factor that may keep me from future purchasing w/o a coupon or gold box discount. Actually I would like to try the entire line-so I really hope it will be featured frequently in the gold box or Friday sale."
2,"A Facial in a Pad: There is enough product on the mini pads to go over your entire face and neck. The fragrence of step 1 smells good.Overall this product does work. It definately clears up your face. I didn't use this product everyday since I wasn't sure if this was a product that contained 100% natural ingredients."
1,"Horrible product, wish I could give it negative stars....: This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare."
2,"SO Expensive BUT...: Great product! I have used many a skin care product and this was by far the best one. But because its so expensive i have to buy it sparingly. (Im not a high roller) I have ordered this product twice in the last year and it works right away. The problem is you really have to use them all in 30 days or the pads will dry up on you. This is dissapointing since i really dont need to use them everyday. Nonetheless this product works...if i had the money i would keep a ready supply in my cabinet."
2,"Beautiful product!: I've reviewed a couple of other Waechtersbach items, and I'm quite happy with these as well! I have only two minor complaints. First, on these, the glaze seems to be scratching (utensils?) more than the other Waechtersbach products I have...my plates and cereal bowls aren't doing that. Second, all four of them had a funny little bump on the outside rim...it looked identical on all four. Maybe a slight manufacturing defect? The glaze is slightly darker around the bump, so you can see it, though it's not overly obvious. But overall I love them - they're great for soups and pasta (spaghetti especially). They're holding up quite well in the dishwasher, too - no chips or cracks, despite how they sort of lean against one another. Very pleased!"
2,"Memoir or Memory?: Although Derrida can be difficult to follow sometimes, this work is extremely intriguing and thought provoking. Well illustrated as well, as should be expected considering it was the catalogue for an exhibition."
2,"Jiggy Fly...worth it: All throughout the basic wraith book they make references to this. They did so with good reason. The info on Soulforging was great, thogh i thought that the focus should have stayed on the more modern powers. The history of the coup is nice, and i thought it was worth the cost"
2,"Fascinating view into the past: This book is fascinating for anyone at all interested in New Zealand history or a general account of life in the past. It is surprisingly well written for what is just a series of letters, and gives a real insight into life as a pioneer in the 1860s, with all its highs and lows. You'll laugh at the author's first attempts at baking, and cry with her as she digs dead lambs from a snowdrift. It's a wonderful book and I heartily recommend it."
2,"A very amusing look at the past: I was hoping for far more details about working and handling sheep in the ways the New Zealander's did in the past when I got this book. Unfortunately, this is a collection of letters from a 'high society' girl that was packed up and moved to the NZ outback with her fiancee. Granted, it's amusing and reasonably interesting to read how she sees the world, as well as a bit insightful into how at least one family thought of their slaves and house maids during a time fortunately long behind us."
1,"Didn't like...: I didn't like this version of the song, ""when you believe,"" even though it was the original. I favored the orchestral rendition of this song which was beautifully arranged by Hans Zimmer."
1,"Two Divas,that should shut up!: Here are two songbirds who are trying to be the best singers of all time. I hate this diva routine! I admit they do have maybe one catchy tune.But,this song is so irritating.Two divas trying to hit the highest notes in one song!I give Whitney one star for her almost Josephine Baker look at the Oscars,you looked fine! And her Children song from the 80's. And Mariah for her badly premeditated sexy image and her undying effort to be the best,major ego! Two divas who should SHUT UP!"
1,"Movie Version is Much better!: The movie version of this song is much better. The Mariah/Whitney version is simply just a screaming contest to see who can sing better. I admit the song is beautiful and touching, but it would have been better if one of them sung it instead of it being a competition. Buy the soundtrack and listen to the movie version. It showcases the song in a much better light."
2,"THE SONG IS SOULFUL: U ARE ONE OF THE BEST SINGERS AND IN THIS SONG THE TWO OF U SOUND ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT. WHEN ARE U COMING TO INDIA"
2,"Wuzzup, Mariah!?! I'm Kaligirl from Seoul!: ""When You Believe"" is an awesome song. To me Mariah's songs hit me like nukes! The awesome duet performed with Whitney Houston I'll never get sick of. This song(to me) is combined with spiritual, and also relates to the racism. I personally recommend this song to both Kids and Adults!"
1,"New Age?: The song is sung beautifully, but is it promoting New Age? Should we believe in ourselves or in God? I think the focus should be more on believing in God and not just in ourselves."
1,"Buddihism book for introspective thought: This is Jack jumping into the Budda scene. Good if you feel like you need a Zen fix, and his observations on how to aspire to happiness are actually quite good too."
2,"Blah: Another wonderful, practically edge-of-conscious novel with no definite plot by everyone's favorite perfectly insane Beat writer. In many ways I enjoy this book even better than 'On the Road.' It contains the same exciting beauty, applied to different subjects,and the same eccentric freedom fighters as lead characters. Every once in a while it attains the perfect harmony it seeks, turning long stretches with no apparent action into meditations on the beauty of nothingness, of loneliness, etc. We see the budding alcoholism of our narrator, which wil turn into a book ('Big Sur') of its own. We see what Kerouac saw in Buddhism, and we'll see converts in the book's readers. Kerouac has perhaps more real-life affect on his readers than any other American novelist, one of the few writers anywhere who really can change lives. Blah."
1,"Not As It Would Seem: Not as advertised. These copies are remaindered and are marked on the bottom as such with a felt-tip line. I had purchased this as a gift but was unable to give it due to the remaindered marking. The online information about these books fail to mention their remaindered status."
2,"VIVA RUCKSACK REVOLUCION!: Cracker Jack's got quite a nack at righting these shindigs about the bums in rucksacks. Dharma Bums gives you a glimpse into the life of the Beats with a focus on their cut of Zen. This really is a great story and it will inspire you. On a side note I recommend trying to find the original edition; the old pages really smell a lot better."
2,"This is Kerouac's real masterpiece!!: I didn't much care for ""On The Road"" after the first 50 pages or so and i'd pretty much thought that this great ""Beat Writer"" was nothing but hype, but after reading ""The Dharma Bums"" I now believe Kerouac is one of the greatest writers of modern times. READ THIS BOOK!!!!"
2,"A pefect battle of religion, alcohol, and poetry.: Published only a year after his masterpiece On The Road, Dharma Bums is a visionary look at the debilitating effects of fame and alcohol. It follows Ray Smith (Jack) and Jahy Rider (Gary Snyder) on a buddhist romp through the mountains of the west coast. Contemplating their religions and beliefs and coming to beautiful realisations about the world (""You can't fall off a mountain""), they create the rucksack revolution. A beautiful insight into thought and poetry. A must for anyone who wants to learn to think or expand their mind."
1,"I'm gonna get blasted for this, but...: ... I just couldn't get into this book. It's a beat classic, so I hear, and it's about traveling and living free and enjoying life on lots of levels. From the descriptions and glowing reviews, I figured I should have loved it. I even read it while I was traveling up the US/Canadian west coast, and I grew up familiar with many of the areas mentioned in the book. In spite of all that, I didn't like it at all. For one thing, it's full of these obscure Buddhist terms and concepts, and although religion is sort of a hobby of mine, I didn't know enough to make sense of all the boddishatva-dropping, and the writing wasn't good enough to make up for that. I guess I just don't like it when the narrator introduces dialogue with ""sez I."""
1,"On the Road Again.: Ok. Let's talk like ordinary people. If you are someone who has to buy a new TV unless you have one, only because the TV is more modern this is your book. If you've read ""ON THE ROAD"", maybe you'll want read something diferent. This is the same book, the same drama, the same wasted money. Can this book change your life?? Yes, but also a stone at high speed could do it also and in less time. Ally McBeal or a Backstreet boys song have more message than this book."
1,"The Kindle version costs more than the paperback: As of this review, the Kindle edition cost $12.99 and the paperback cost $10.88 - or over $2 more expensive for a digital version that actually saves the publisher money. I actually enjoy Dharma Bums, but Penguin should be absolutely ashamed of themselves for this. I wanted to reread this on my Kindle, but Penguin has decided to screw the readers who keep its business afloat. I'll be sure to keep this in mind for future purchases.Also, for those who will bash my review, the cost of the book is an essential to the value proposition of a book. There are constant bad reviews for publishers that break up short story collection and sell them individually for the price of an individual book. This is no different. Penguin wants me to spend nearly $300 for a Kindle and a case so that they can charge me more for books, all while they save money on production costs??? You've got to be joking!"
1,"Don't bother: I tried to give Kerouac a chance to revive himself after reading his most notable mess 'On the Road.' Now I'm thoroughly confused as to why he's so popular."
1,"Kerouac is not that great: Maybe I am not as enlightened as all of you, but I don't think this book is all that great. Kerouac is often completely incoherent. Much of what is said is nonsense. Further more I don't understand why everyone wants to be a Dharma Bum, they are nothing but leaches living off what others earn. It is a decent read, especially the mountain climbing scene, but not as great as some make it out to be, definitely not life changing."
1,"Failed to be powerful...or even interesting: One might expect an interesting, down-to-earth account of one poet's buddhist discoveries and spiritual growth, but this wasn't done right: the characters are one-dimensional, contrived, and act like buddhist wanna-bes. (Is a person a real Buddhist if he is proud of his Buddhism?)What was a powerful and introspective journey for Kerouac, is not for the reader. I can tell that it's there, but Kerouac just doesn't get it all the way across. I found myself rolling my eyes, but still trying to give him the benefit of the doubt.If this will be your first Kerouac read, as it was for me, choose something else or it may forever turn you off to Kerouac, who could be an otherwise fabulous story-teller.If he is, let me know."
1,"Shallow: I found Dharma Bums suprising. I thought On the Road was one of the most rambling, self-indulgent books that I've ever read, but I realized that Dharma Bums is even more so. The book reminded me how the degeneration of American intellectual life began with the Beats who, at least when they were in the '50's, were self-rightous and shallow, not to mention drunk womanizers, an odd trait for devout Buddhists. This book is a cultural artifact from the Beat era, but not a book to add to one's must-read list. Life is short. Read better."
1,"Conceited book: Had to offset the praise handed down by so many people for Karourac's writings. Very overrated as a writer. This book is filled with the resemblance of substance, but has nothing in it. It is a contradiction of itself."
1,"One show about nothing is enough: OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac."
1,"Bummer: Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it. So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing. Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it."
2,"I wanted to say ""Damn!"": ...but I had to expound on that on account of all these bad reviews.If this book is not for you to get then that's fine and it's sad, but don't be so angry--coherence isn't everything. It's the heart that makes Kerouac, the sailing, pounding, beautiful, soulful, angry, churning, palpable heart.And for those who worry that this is required scene material, the beat poets are dead, let them be. Read for yourself and its own rewards. That should be obvious; now go, enjoy this epic soul journey."
2,"Excellent follow-up to ""On the Road"": ""The Dharma Bums"" is an excellent follow-up to Jack Kerouac's famous second novel, ""On the Road,"" a must-read for all Kerouac fans. Pay special attention to the infamous mountain climb by Kerouac, Gary Snyder, and John Montgomery--lots of great imagery, language, and central themes of life there. This book changed my life forever. It also contains the famous poetry reading (where Allen Ginsberg read ""Howl"") at 6 Gallery in San Francisco (Oct. 7, 1955)."
2,"a different Kerouac: A more laid back series of tales from the life of Jack Kerouac. Very relaxing, unlike ""On the Road"". Makes you want to go climb a mountain."
2,"Good read: Great read. If you have something mote profound to read I would suggest that. All in all a great story though."
2,"Kerouac's finest, most blissful novel...you MUST read it!: Yes, ""On The Road"" gets all the attention, but this follow-up work is by far his most gorgeous and uplifting...from sleeping on the beach to climbing a mountain, to the flowering of his Buddhist consciousness, Jack really takes the reader with him. Filled with plenty of movement, bohemian idealism with Ginsberg and Snyder, self-discovery, joy, etc, this is simply where Jack shows himself as most fully alive and in love with the magic of experience. ""Dharma Bums"" soars as high as ""Big Sur"" dives to the depths of agony. Read this book, and you WILL feel the beauty of life without anchors."
1,"Dont waste your time: Uninteresting and boring, the story accomplishes nothing from start to finish. Save your time and money and dont bother with this book."
1,"Sometimes it works: At first this printer worked well, but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with, you can't print more than 4-5 pages before the ""page grabber"" will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time, and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver, which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short, this was my last HP printer. The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle."
2,"A must-have for any theological library: This is THE definitive book on Reformed Presbyterian theology. Hodge is strong not only in what he explains, but also how he explains it. Each section is divided into questions, as if someone was interviewing Hodge. He then answers each question in a very logical, ordered manner, giving the reader a very clear perception of each particular concept. Hodge leaves nothing uncovered, but rather touches on a very wide spectrum of Reformed theology, and every time his argument is succinct and backed with scripture. Everyone interested in theology, clergy or lay-person, should read this book to gain a deeper understanding of what the Reformed persuasion believes and why."
1,"Great book, but not this Kindle edition: There's no question on the importance of Hodge's book. But this $3 Kindle edition is simply scanned with OCR and is almost worthless. It would have been far easier to read it in simple image form."
1,"Poor Kindle edition: My negative comments have nothing to do with the content as Hodge wrote it, which is excellent. But the quality of the Kindle edition is very poor. The OCR scan has resulted in unintelligible words in almost every paragraph, and the lack of links in the table of contents severely limits the usefulness as a reference source. It's not completely useless; in general I can find what I'm looking for and make sense out of the text. So for 99 cents I suppose I'm getting my money's worth. But an edition of better quality would be most welcome."
1,"horrid e-text: This kindle version is not worth the money, even if very cheap. It is a poor uncorrected ocr scan. It is unreadable and unusable. Find a cleaner edition. This is a rip-off."
1,"Tell me what you think: Bazyn's next project should be a ransom note. This was a collection of quotes taken from other writers, pieced together, and presented as a book. I don't think there was a single paragraph that did not have a quote. It is one thing to use quotes to support your work, or to provide examples. It is entirely different, and unacceptable, for an author to use quotes to make all of the author's points.Good premise. Poor product. Disappointing."
2,"Workout CD: I don't really remember what's on this one. I purchased to install in my MP3 for walking/jogging and it's fine"
1,"Plot? What Plot?: The usual action scenes, but ridiculous plot holes. The vast majority of the plot points made no sense whatsoever, I think Michael Bay is trying to make the worst possible movie that still makes millions of dollars."
1,"Just Not Worthwhile: I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one."
1,"Absolute trash.: I went into this movie hoping it could be better than TF2. It is, but not by much. I'm going to be honest. I think Transformers 2 is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I saw the 3rd one, but the Chicago part looked interesting. Little did I know it would take 2 long boring hours to get that part. On top of that. It wasn't even that impressive. I hate Shia's parents. I hate his new girlfriend. I hate Michael Bay humor. I hate this movie and I hate the fact I spent 12 bucks to go see it. I don't think Michael Bay understand that everything gets boring without a plot or some kind of tension going on. It's so BORING. I literally sat in the theater hoping it was over only to look at my watch and see that only 10 minutes had passed."
1,"WAIT!!: As you have read, wait for the deluxe version later in the year. So for now, just rent it for now!!!"
1,"Wait for Special Edition: I made the mistake of buying this version. But luckily I didn't open it once I got home, so I was able to return it today. I'm not going to fall for the same money trap again(Avatar). I'll just wait a few months and get the Special Edition one with all the extra features.Now me just ranting here for a bit. But what the hell Paramount, I know times are tough for everyone but do you have to do this to us. Trying to rip off the loyal customers is not good business."
2,"Transformers - Dark of the Moon (Blu-ray): Continuous action and mayhem - it's hard to beat the initial Transformer movie (first one) but ""They"" again did an excellent attept."
1,"Dark Moon: Not what I expected, the first Transformers was the best. The special effects was great but acting was not, too bad."
2,"Farily decent movie: I didn't like some of the plot twist, of a former leader of the Autobots but other than that it was pretty good."
2,"blessed: it just gets better ever time do you know if there will be a 4th one, i loved the action but come on does it have to be a super model evertime that is the girl?"
1,"I didn't buy this movie because it was too dumb.: I think Michael Bay may have phoned this one in. There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't know where to begin."
1,"DIRECTOR's PERSONAL SIGNATURE ......???????????: UPON leaving my 9 year old insised to know EXCATLY what was happening in the bathroom stall?SPOUSE was blank .... I hummed and hawwed .....IS THAT SEQUENCE ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED?"
1,"you pay less at the theater: Its just thye movie with no special features.I made the mistake of buying it. Had i known i would have never bought it. Avoid wait till the special features come out."
2,"Best Transformers movie ever.: Easily the best film in the series. Tranformers: Dark of the Moom is the summer event film I have been waiting for. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake. While I loved the first two for what they were, this one has a more authentic story and tighter narrative. Finally a 3D movie with actually depth in the shots! Your jaw will definitely drop in certain scenes."
1,"If you're 16+ don't bother: These transformer movies are horrible. The special effects are the only good thing about these movies. The actors, especially the main actor have drab storylines, stupid dialogue, and the transformer voices are poor. Unless you're a kid, this movie is not for you."
1,"crappy acting: i was really looking forward to the new movie i was so mad when i found out that megan fox got booted i knew that it would be hard to replace her not cuz shes beautiful but storyline wiseman they really messed things up in this one its sooo diff story wise than other towfirst off i hate the girl in it yeah shes hot but she doesnt fit in megan was a poor hot girl didnt mind getting dirty or fighting this girl is spoiled rich girl afraid to break a nail type and theres no background really to there love so were suppose to believe hes so head over heals he wants to marry her?also her acting really sucked and so did sha laboufs i thought he was on speed the whole movie talked way to fast and way overly drmaticthe beginging to middle of the movie was lame they tried way to hard to make it funny when what made transformers so great the first two times was that it was almost like unentional jokeshowvere the middle to end of the movie was excellent"
1,"no speacial features: This is a good movie. Just stay away from this version. I was excited and bought it on release day only to find out that it is just the feature film. I was really disappointed. I would never have purchased this movie if I had known that it was the feature only. Yes, I know, in my excitement to get the movie, it was my own fault for not looking carefully at the back of the box, although, nowhere could I find that it says feature film only. I used to download movies illegally. I stopped and started buying them legit again because the special features are really enjoyable. When the companies charge full price for the feature only (which i can get from netflix anyway), I feel cheated. Maybe everyone should start downloading illegally and really send hollywood or whoever a message that if they want our hard earned money they need to work a little harder for it. This is just my rant."
1,"Bogus - no special features - rent it, don't buy.: (SORRY...THIS IS FOR BLU-RAY, NOT AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO) Would have given 4 stars for the movie/blu-ray, but I was very disappointed there were no special features at all - not even notes. That's the main reason I like DVDs and blu-rays so much...for the special features that may contain commentary, interviews, behind the scenes and show how some of the FX were done - explosions and such. I'm sure they will release another version in the near future with the special features movie buffs enjoy and spend more cash$ Who the hell comes out with a new release Blu-ray in this day & age with ZERO special features??? DO NOT BUY - RENT FROM RED BOX."
1,"DONT BUYYYYYYYYYY!!!: Dont give money to these filmakers that later on down the road release a better version of the same movie..If you want extra features this version WILL NOT have it on the disc!! Wait for the deluxe version!"
1,"Not even rental worthy: Ok so I heard that this was better than the last Transformers (didn't see that one), so I thought it must be ok. It's got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Horrible acting, not sure why Shia LaBeouf is an actor...think Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, but without the charisma. If you are into cartoons,explosions and superficial story telling then it might be palatable for you....otherwise you'd be better off watching the grass grow."
1,"Love 3D hate the Price.: who is on crack that they think any movie is worth 42 dollars 3D or not. This is just another scam like with cell companies and internet providers charging for data like there is some limited amount that isnt self imposed. The technology is not so overwhelming in RD to cost 4 times that of dvd and twice that of blu ray.Dont get me wrong love 3D and this was one of the best 3D movies I have seen but honestly 42 dollars just is taking advantage of consumers in a market that has no where else to go. If this disk was 30 bucks Id by it hesitantly but thats the problem with blu ray they charge way to much for the theatre experience. Sad too cause this movie and captain america are ones i would have bought but i refuse to let them think this is a good going price for the gimmick."
1,"that kid wit wickie yell like a woman all movie like he was pms ruin the movie.: the movie was bad the kid ruined it yellign and being angry the whole time. And it was the same as the last 2 movies nothing out very boring ending was ok."
1,"sucks: i just got one word this movie blows one of the worst movies i have seen in a long time the first part of the movie put my wife to sleep. any body who reads this it is not even take the time our the money to by this movie"
1,"kind of a pathetic dvd: I guess i should have done more research before i bought this. I enjoy the transformers franchise and even though i feel like the 2nd and 3rd movie will never live up to the quality of the 1st I enjoyed this one enough to decide to buy this bluray/dvd hoping that the blu ray format and additional special features would keep me entertained. Well when you put the movie in you are treated to; the movie, different audio languages, and nothing no commentary, behind the scenes, deleted scenes,etc.......If you want nothing but a movie buy it off itunes or something, I'd recommend getting the other special edition version that i learned about after I already bought this one"
2,"Great Movie: Purchased this dvd as a gift. It arrived well within the alloted time and was well packaged. Another good buy through Amazon, my place to shop! EP"
2,"Great movie can't wait for the Blu ray: I have seen this movie 2 times in theaters. Optimus Prime turns bad ass in this one when he says ""We will kill them all"". The wreckers are great as well as Sideswipe and Mirage. I strongly recommend."
1,"I feel as if I got scammed by Paramount: Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)"
2,"Transformers: This was an okay movie. You must enjoy the Bay Transformers Universe in order to enjoy this film. Oh yeah, and big explosions."
2,"Transformer: Items waas as described and shipped on time. Was a gift and just what was asked for. Item was in very good condition."
2,"Transformers: This movie is a simply an action movie. It has the explosions, the cars, and the drama of an action movie and not much else. But then again, how much more do you need for a entertaining movie? With the level of graphics, a blu-ray is especially nice."
2,"Awesome movie: If you seen the first two you will definately find this one the best! We first seen it in 3D at the movies and knew how good it was. By far go get this movie. My youngest son is a Transformers freak, and we've seen this about 1,000 times since we bought it! Awesome Film!"
1,"Uggh, such a waste of potential!: I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. But Dark of the Moon was difficult to sit through for me. Endless dialogue with minimal action sequences, I found myself looking at the time far too often. They dropped Meghan Fox, who despite her controversial reputation, definitely added to the cast. The special effects are still amazing, but there just wasn't enough action. BORING!!! If they are going to continue with this franchise they had better turn it up a few notches."
2,"It was like awesome: Most definitely a wonderful buy and beats the big box store price. The movie was awesome and I can't say enough about the whole experiece."
2,"plenty of action and humor: consistent production quality like first two movies in the series..and like the other series movies,plenty of humor from the additional characters ( and first-rate actors) thruout the movie"
2,"action: Great action movie, intense, demographics was awesome. Definitely a but movie to watch again, but with prime time i can without buying it!!"
2,"Good movie: I like all of the transformers movies. This one is fun too. I would recommend it to any fan of the first two movies."
1,"AVOID at all costs!!!: If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."
1,"DONT DOUBLE DIP!! WAIT FOR THE BETTER VERSION: This version is being rushed out at the end of this month. Michael Bay has stated that a Bigger and Better 3D bluray version will be released later, with ALOT more extras than this edition. That version will be release on standard Blu as well, Looks like before the end of this year, just in time for the holidays."
2,"Love Them All... But this is the best: I love all of the Transformer movies but I think this is the best one. Really well done. The only complaint is the absence of Megan Fox as the girlfriend. I mean how do you dump a guy you have saved the world with twice???"
1,"Michael Bay should be barred from making more movies.: This film was by far, the most mediocre, melodramatic, hackneyed, and banal piece of work that Bay has ever put on screen.If you have the mentality of a ten-year-old, then yes, you'll find this film entertaining, but for all adults out there, you should best skip this thing."
1,"Digital copy is expired: Digital copy expired 2 months ago so unable to put it on ipad. Would not have bought if i knew the digital copy wasnt included"
2,"Great !!: So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on wich it displays me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were very limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!"
1,"Suck it Michael Bay: Boobies, explosions, and maybe the fight/transformation scenes would have been awesome with theater version basss/surround sound. A waste of time. Unless you're drunk. Then it's ok."
1,"Even Amazon Prime can't Save Optimus Prime this time: Ugh! What a steaming pile of predictability this movie was. At least I didn't pay to see it and was able to read a software tech manual while ""watching"" this. The plot is thinner than the paper it was written on and the acting, well its typical Michael Bay which means you can see more believable productions at you local high school. It was easily an hour too long and the special effect have been used hundreds before. I think the saddest part was hearing Lenard Nimoy as Optimus Sentimental, I mean Sentinel. Gratuitous sci-fi pandering at it's lowest."
1,"Be careful when searching for ""3-D movies"": I used the search window using ""3-d movies"" as the criteria and this movie popped up along with dozens of other 3-d movies, but when I received it, I realized I had not read the description close enough to see that this movie was NOT 3-d. Amazon-please don't place 2-d movies selections in with the 3-d ones! I had to pay $2.98 to return an item that shouldn't have been offered in a search of 3-d movie selections. Ouch. All in all I love Amazon, but I'll be more careful in the future. My bad."
1,"unwatchable: The first few Transformers movies had awful dialog, bad acting, and substituted explosions for plot. And still I actually managed to sit all the way through them. I got about 45 minutes into this one and couldn't go on. Awful."
2,"Great movie: Who does not like all the transformer movies? Great special effects everytime. Worth buying and watching several times. Does not get ld watching."
1,"Horrible: It isn't very often that I turn off a movie and walk away before it has ended but this movie was deserving of such behavior. Damn you Michael Bay for killing my childhood memories about Transformers. I believed that you were sincere when apologizing for the previous embarrassment that netted you a lot of money and wanted to believe that this movie would be better. No, it wasn't. Where is your pride? Better yet, where is your soul. Wait, I can see it circling the drain ready to disappear forever. I will never watch any of your movies again and hope the same for others. you. sick. bastard."
1,"Dreadful: It's marginally better than the second of the series, with action sequences that border on coherent, but just a few minutes in it's already pointlessly foolish, and doesn't do much to redeem itself over the next few hours. Big robots, smash smash smash. Whatever."
1,"Awful movie.: Standard Michael Bay garbage. Totally removed from the original idea, especially concerning Optimus Prime's character. The ideals the character originally stood for are completely ignored in favor of kill shots and 'Murican tough guy crap."
1,"waste of time: continuity was not there, story line was unknown. so unrealistic, non continuous, special effect show that even that was no good."
1,"Enough already: Two of these movies was plenty. The hot girl was so ridiculously hot as to be unbelievable and not in a good way."
1,"Unremarkable, but not as bad as the previous installment: I don't even remember the plot, the resolution, or much else about this. However, I also don't remember it being painfully bad as the previous installment was. You should not go out of your way to watch this, but there are worse movies."
1,"WAAAY TOO MUCH CG!: I got dizzy watching the machines transform. I only watched the movie to see Chicago, because I live there. Needless to say, I did not like this movie."
1,"One of the worst movies ever.: The acting is horrible. The story is nonexistent. This is a movie that is surely not worth your time.The special effects are its one redeeming factor, but they can't redeem this movie. The only good thing about this compared to Transformers 2 is that there is less screaming in this one."
1,"Bleh: It takes more than special effects to make a movie. The first film was good, the 2nd one mostly decent, but this was unadulterated, predictable, garbage, full of bad acting eye candy. The heroine of this tale couldn't find a coherent sentence with a conjunctive map. Should have stuck with Megan Fox. At least she had some real attitude."
1,"Unwatchably boring: ~40 minutes in, so bored I quit. Seriously, unintertained to the extent that I closed the browser. Honestly, though I've stopped watching a movie from lack of interest before, it's never been this bad. Also, the first forty minutes did not start up any comprehensible plot."
1,"Cant get narrator off !!!!!!!!! help !!! new dvd: I cant get the narrator off in the background.. I tried 3 different dvd players.. Anyone know how ? email me at gibby@sev.org."
1,"Transformers: I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting"
1,"A waste of special effects . . .: and a complete waste of electricity. Michael Bay has not been hungry for years, therein lies the problem. Let's see what happens in the inevitable sequel."
1,"Avoid if you want ANY extra features.: First, I really enjoyed the movie. Like the other two films, this was a lot of fun to watch because you can disengage and simply enjoy the action.The bad news is that if you care anything about extra features, this is not the release for you. A blu-ray like this is completely unacceptable and is truly a money grab. Wait for the next release which is suppose to come out later this year. From now on I'll pay more attention to the release notes. I haven't bought anything like this in quite some time."
1,"Pathetic: Please find something else to do for two and half hours.There is are so many things wrong with this movie to list, but I will say there was one redeeming quality of the movie and that was actor John Malkovich.As I said I am not going to go into all the things that made this movie horrible, but I will say for just about two hours I was hoping it would end and every time I had enough, John did his thing and I was back to watching the movie.I had thought number two was bad but his one was even worse and lets hope that they never make another one.Timahh"
1,"Kiddie Fodder...: Crap, crap, crap. Bad acting, big explosions, and video game CGI a good movie does not make. Like a 2 hour Hasbro toy commercial. This film made Star Wars Episode 1 with Jar Jar Binks seem like an Academy Award worthy film. And I'm a Superhero/Godzilla/Monster geek...this is just awful...terrible. At least the first one was semi-watchable--and where's Megan Fox? That would have been the only redeeming quality in this junk-fest...I mean alien robots who change into cars and trucks??? It's a movie based on a TOY for God's sake! A bad toy made into an even worse film. Avoid like The Plague."
2,"best movie of the 3!!!: this was by far the best of the 3 movies. the human interaction is better and the robot battles are infinitely better. from the beginning of the movie to the end is non-stop action. this is one of the few movies i saw 2 times in the theater. once in the regular screen and once in imax 3D. it was money well spent. i would tell anyone who is thinking of buying it, to DEFINITELY buy it!"
1,"Movie is horrible...: Bad acting and a cheap love story make this one of the worst Transformers movie to date. I wish the Transformers movies would focus more on the actual transformers of the movie instead of a bad love story. I remember Transformers the animated movie was all about the transformers and didn't try to focus too much on the humans and their problems. The fight with Megatron was epic and Unicron was an amazing villain. And the rivalry between Skyscream and Megatron made for an interesting plots on the decepticon side. The exploration and fights on the distant planets was fun and exciting. My suggestion to make this movie great instead of bad or mediocre is to fire all the bad actors and do a movie strictly about the transformers and their backgrounds. Or simply remake the animated movie into an actual motion picture."
1,"No 3D Bluray in this release, no sale.: Double dip express continues and continues and continues......Thankfully we have Amazon reviews to keep a few buyers from losing out, much like the LOTR Blurays.Still as long as there are consumers to buy these initial skimmed down releases and the studio can make a profit the farce will carry on."
1,"epic fail: very disappointing. The plot for sam was really lame, the woman they got for his fiance was the worst actress ive ever seen. pretty sure its because she is a model and doesnt know the first thing about acting. the movie was ok as an action movie but if you buy this expecting something on par with the first two movies you will be sadly disappointed."
1,"This film gave me brain damage: First of all, its boring. At the 30 minute mark I forgot what movie I was watching. And at two separate points in the film (I forget what points, in fact I seemed to lose all perspective on time) I literally went cross eyed. My right eye is still lingering in a lazy wobble at the moment. All I really do remember was rooting for Leonard Nimoy to destroy the planet and all the retarded humans that inhabit it.Things I learned from T3 - Michael Bay's film making talents could effectively be adapted into a new kind of non-surgical lobotomy procedure for mental patients. I think I dodged the bullet on permanent catatonia due to the fact that I spent half of the movie day dreaming about more exciting things in my life...like porn, and rearranging my sock drawer."
1,"This movie is the definition of bad: Many of the reviews on here praise this movie for it's visual prowess. Personally I think that is like praising a brain dead super model. Yeah, it looks good and the action sequences are crazy. However, it has NO semblence of a plot. The movie as a whole is incoherent, disjointed, and just generally stupid. Nothing flows, and everything from the acting to the diologue is terrible. I don't know what the director was smoking when he inflicted this peice of shit on the world, but if you have half a brain you will find it as insufferable as I did. Don't waste your time."
2,"cool movie: i had never watched this movie and happened to start watching it with my company and found it to have great animation to it. would recommend to anyone."
2,"SciFi Movie: Plenty of action and almost lives up to the others in the franchise. However, not to be missed or overlooked as one of the btter robot wars themed movies."
1,"Avoid.. Falsely advertised: Very disappointed with this purchase. I bought this based on product details on Amazon which listed special features and extras - a major reason for my choice. There is only the movie on bluray and DVD. Please correct item details Amazon."
1,"Terrible. Horrible. Awful movie.: Much too long, excruciatingly boring and all Shia LaBeouf does is scream for over 2 hours. I made the horrible mistake of actually BUYING this movie."
1,"Dear Mr. Bay, Please stop ruining the Transformers franchise: I love to see the Transformers in movies but I will never get the time back that I spent watching this movie. Good actors in a crap movie do not make a good movie. Fantastic special effects do not make a good movie. A well written story and characters that you care about make a good movie."
1,"Starts of with a bang but fades: I enjoyed the first Transformers immensely. It was quirky, fun and exciting. I'd heard Dark Side of the Moon had recaptured some of that magic. And at first it mostly did. But then, like so many big budget action movies it devolved into noise, machines smashing one another one frame after another, after another, after another... And at over 2.5 hours in length you reach a point where you stop caring. You could edit out a third of the content and it would have been a better movie."
1,"Redefinition of LAME: I had low expectations and they still weren't met. My only satisfaction is that I didn't have to pay to see it on Amazon Instant Video but I'll never get my time back. Seriously, this movie has redefined LAME; bad acting, bad editing, bad script. If it weren't for the two little fuzzbots, it would have been a total loss. The ""stars"" who did this film must have had a bad round of luck in Vegas and desparately needed the money. Don't waste 2.5 hours of your life on this, especially when there is so much other less crappy stuff to watch!"
1,"At least the special effects were fun: The special effects (and the fact that I am from Chicago) were the only things about this movie that I liked. The story was dumb and the acting SUCKED!! I can only recommend this for someone who has absolutely nothing else to do and doesn't mind sacrificing a couple of hours."
2,"fabuloso: mil gracias por el producto fabuloso recomiendo a este vendedor todo llego en perfectas condiciones excelentesaludos espero seguir contando con ustedes"
1,"Waste of time: There are movies that make you wonder what's going on, but they do so on purpose. In this movie, I was confused from the start and obviously not on purpose. It has no actual plot just an excuse for more graphics. Where as 1st movie had some plot, the last 2 had none. Waste of time."
1,"So bad: The previews of this movie were the best things about it! The female lead's obviously surgically altered lips were distracting and the idea of people slamming into buildings and sliding through broken glass uninjured was laughable. The transformers were awesome but how long can you watch those scenes before enough is enough. So bad,so disappointing so save your money!"
1,"This ... movie ... sucks: At least the other Transformers movies had Megan Fox for eye candy. Rosie-my-plastic-surgeon-went-berserk-with-the-silicone-and-that's-why-I-have-ginormous-lips-that-don't-move-Huntington-Whiteley is ugly. My eyes hurt from watching her and this movie. Rented this movie only out of morbid curiosity. There, that's all that needs to be said."
1,"Lousy: This movie became so boring I stopped watching it after an hour and a half. I liked the first one much better."
1,"Geh: Blah blah, sexy girl, blah blah, fighting robots, blah blah, cliche action lines, blah blah, talking robots, blah blah blah."
1,"Boring: Less of a plot than the first movies. Fell asleep twice watching it, despite all the explosions....Seems like the writers may be running out of ideas"
1,"Weak: I enjoyed the 1st Transformers movie for what it was. Found the 2nd to be unwatchable. This one is better than the second one but what is that saying."
1,"Try to see how long you have to watch before you realize this movie is a disaster...: It only took me about 15 minutes. These Transformers movies keep getting more expensive and equally more ridiculous. The first one was charming and really funny, especially the first half. The humor reminded me of Armageddon. I actually liked Shia LaBeouf back then. This one tries way too hard in every aspect and fails in almost all of them. I understand these movies are not to be taken too seriously (I mean this is one step up from Power Rangers), but this movie could've been presented much better.The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the special effects and action sequences were exciting at times."
1,"awful: This movie was terrible. No plot, action was written by a 10 yr old Shia is beyond annoying and the actress who's name I'm not going to bother to look up can't act and wasn't much to look at either."
1,"Boring and Stupid: Dark Side of the Moon makes the first Transformers movie look like Citizen Kane. I got about halfway through this movie before I had to stop watching. The plot was utterly nonsensical. I had no sympathy for any of the characters--the sooner Megatron kills Shia LeBoeuf the better--in my opinion. The action scenes were so convoluted, I couldn't even tell what was supposed to be happening nine times out of ten. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE, Michael Bay, Don't make another Transformers Movie."
2,"100% Satsified: The item arrived in perfect condition. The transaction was easy, convenient, and service was efficient. I've used this seller on other occasions and have never had a problem. I am completely satisfied and would highly recommend to others. In this case, I chose the seller because of good experience in the past, despite a slightly higher price-- and still a great bargain!"
1,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon: This is a disappointing film. The first two films managed to include a story with the special effects. This one didn't really bother. Mind numbing, and in a bad way."
2,"The best so far: Great popcorn flick. Big difference between the dvd & bluray. The digital copy has been great since we own an iPad"
2,"Transformers: Love it but not as good as the other 2. Shia is great as always and love the soundtrack also but that is just me. Very good graphics but I was really paying more attention to the story and ya gotta just love it when dictator obama is spliced into a movie as the good leader that he isn't and they made George W. Bush look like an idiot. But this is hollywood and they suck."
1,"Not more than meets the eye: 20 dollars and 2 1/2 hours I can never get back. I was disappointed by this movie I am actually embarrassed I bought it last Friday when it came out. My kids were so excited but after 2 hours even they had enough. During the scene where the building is crashing down My 9 year old asked What did Optimus Prime go on a lunch break? Once he did show up he made short work of the bad guys. The action scenes were amazing at first but became boring and tedious real fast. Shia LeBeouf is awful, his stupid jokes always seemed to come at the most inappropriate times. John Turturro's character may be the most stupid, intelligent character in a movie ever. No character development, no real emotion and Transformers that in many scenes never even fought back. If you have to rent it skip the first 45 minutes, but don't buy it it's just not worth it."
1,"Disappointing!: Just got this Blu Ray and just found out there is no DTS sound unlike what the description says on Amazon. Wait for the better version!"
1,"I Wish I Could Give Zero Stars: This is by far the worst of all the Transformer movies. Every scene with Shia and his blowup girlfriend is a slap in the face to modern women. After watching for thirty minutes, I realized I had wasted enough of my time and stopped the film. If I had paid for this, I would have thrown a temper tantrum until I got a full refund."
1,"A Time Waster: This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Poor Shia has to have a high paid model to make his acting look better."
1,"Not 3D: THis company advertised this as a 3D movie. When I received it it was only a Blu-ray. They told me I would have to ship it back to them to prove it. I was very upset and they are horribel to work with."
1,"Painful 2 and a half hours: I wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but figured it would be a fun enough way to zone out for a while. Wow was it ever worse than I thought it could be! Full of ""clever"" one-liners, bad characters (both humans and robots... really? There's an old British autobot named ""Q"" who designs fancy gadgets and weapons?), and action that was at times fun, but for the most part incredibly drawn out and ultimately just boring. Basically this was 2.5 hours (and it feels like 4) of unpleasantly spent time."
1,"Provincial: There's so much to say about what's dumb about this movie, but it has one thing going for it: pretty colors flickering fast. A great movie when you want to give your brain a rest. Best viewed on mute."
1,"Transformers: Well, I didn't think the series would get worse , but it did.This movie is not only bad , I wouldn't buy this on DVD, Blu Ray , or on bootleg.This is as bad as it gets for action movies . I will keep the first Transformers movie and forget about the others that followed."
1,"I fell asleep.: I know it sounds hard to believe, this movie being so loud and ""spectacular,"" but I was just so bored by the giant gizmos shooting at each other again, I fell asleep."
1,"A bunch of CGI crap.....: The girl who replaces Megan Fox wears white the ENTIRE MOVIE, it borderlines stupidity. The movie is just garbage, I'm not gonna waste your time telling you every bad detail, but it almost seems that several things were done just to piss Megan Fox off completely ignoring story line."
1,"Hmmmmm.: I really enjoyed the first two live-action Transformers movie but this one ... no! I was definitely disappointed with the casting of Sam's new love interest. There was a lot of action but it seemed ""action for the sake of action."" I felt that the picture ""worked too hard at being good."" There were times I couldn't tell who was autobot and who was decepticon. Some of the scenes were extremely crude and others tried my patience. So no Megatron, no Ironhide, and no Sentinel Prime. We have the one-armed Optimus and the unscaved Bumblebee. Agent Simmons was there being well ... he was there. Better luck next time, Bay."
1,"Ugh!: The nicest thing I can say about this movie is it is really bad. There's talent to burn in the cast but they should have burned the script instead. The script is so terrible it makes ""Never Too Young To Die"" look Oscar-worthy. Rosie Huntington is like a blonded Megan Fox but without the charm or gravitas (which Ms. Fox isn't exactly awash in either so you can tell how wooden her replacement is). The movie is actually painful to watch for teh first 2/3 but at least some of the action scenes in the final third are cool enough to make it not a total loss."
1,"Bad movie? You're soaking in it: Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague."
1,"This movie doesnt deserve any stars...: Total mind rape of a movie. This was by far the greatest let down of 2011. I found this movie disrespectful to the true Transformer fans and see this regurgitation as a middle finger from Micheal Bay to all of us. If your a True Transformer fan stay away."
1,"Disappointed: I bought this for my husband for his birthday, and was disappointed when I got it. It said online that it was a 2-disc and I only got one disc. It wasn't in it's original packaging, and I payed as much for it as I would in a store."
1,"Ouch: In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes."
1,"Amazon video streaming does not work: Tried Amazon's video streaming for the first time for Transformers via the TV, but sadly it did not work. We have watched many movies from Netflix so surprised when this did not work especially after paying $3.99. Looks like I need to go back to DVD rentals for new releases at the blockbuster kiosk."
2,"Review on the movie: Seriously, people? It really makes me laugh to read people going on and on about how horrible this movie was. I understand if you are a fan of the Transformers in the 80s that you might be upset, but I'm not and I liked this movie. You aren't supposed to over-analyze movies like this! Just watch the good graphics, attractive people, and be entertained! This franchise isn't something that is supposed to make you think. I mean really. Anyway, I just wanted to put in my 2 cents. I think this was far better than the 2nd one, which was very lacking. The graphics are good and it's entertaining, especially if you have some time to kill and just want to turn your brain off and be entertained."
2,"Dark of the Moon DVD: Great value for money. I purchased this DVD for my son as he loves Transformers. Received the DVD before the estimated date and before it was due to be released in Australia.We were only interested in the movie(extras etc not a big deal for my son) so it was a very good buy.Quality of movie was good too."
2,"From Gods to Machines: I received the message that the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. But all governments hide information from the masses of their people. What intrigued me was when the Sentinel Prime character said to the Optimus Prime character that they used to be gods and now they were called machines. I can relate to that statement. I am a descendant of a people that were performing high sciences at one point in time and now we are beasts of burden. Try to talk to a typical African person about science and see what you get. At best they'll say, how does this help me pay my bills? At worse they'll look at you like you have 2 heads."
2,"best video ever!: THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST MOVIE ANYONE WILL EVER SEE IN THEIR ENTIRE FREAKING LIFE! BEST MOVIE EVER! IT ROCKS!"
1,"Dosen't play well: This DVD does not play well at all. I wish I would have purchased this elsewhere. The price for this should have been much less to equal the quality."
2,"AMAZING: Just went to the premiere and holy crud is that movie legit. Tons of laughs, emotion and of course the best action special affects you'll ever see. Definitely go see it if you loved the first 2 or even liked. You'll be into this one the whole way through"
1,"Really boring and very flat 3D: I've tried watching this movie twice now and have fallen asleep about half way through each time. The opening plot is really boring and the 3D is flat and uninteresting. Good 3D needs to have a few things flying out of the screen once in a while ... this doesn't. My friends tell me the ending is pretty good but I've never stayed conscious long enough to see it.My advise - get the new Resident Evil 3D instead - if you like stuff flying around this has it --- POW!Cheue"
1,"simply stupid: A waist of time, money, and brain cells. Do not waist your time with this pointless drivel. This makes me hope they never make another attempt at a Transformers movie."
1,"Yes, but no cigar: Why did I buy this thing? Well, I saw a preview and it was great. Make no mistakes, is a good movie if you like machines beating up humans without the humans being make into jelly.The opening was the best in the world. If they had only kept it that way... But no. It desintegrated into pieces. The FXs were fabulous, but you can't make a whole movie out of that.Sorry fans. I was disappointed, but then I'm not a kid anymore, so that's probably the reason."
1,"Super...cynical!: Paramount has soared to new heights of ""vulture-ness,"" patiently sitting on a branch for the last sap to buy this on Blu-ray before conveniently swooping in on said saps with the 3-D release. (Can't remember if Thor hit theaters as a 3-D movie, but I think it did, and Paramount is using the same release strategy there.) Please resist this strategy fellow would-be saps. The movie is a solid 3 (couple of weak plot lines)...the release strategy gets it rated a weak 1!!"
1,"Poorly Made DVD: I'm glad I rented this one first, because image quality was horrible. I popped the disc in my PC to take a look, and discovered the movie was only 2.8GB. What was Paramount thinking? A DVD can hold 8+ GB. The more space that's used, the higher the bitrate. A low bitrate results in poor image quality. So, what we get is a DVD that's nearly empty, and a highly compressed mess of a movie. Thanks for nothing, Hollywood."
1,"Pre-Order Screw Up: This review does not reflect anything about the movie. I pre-ordered this item Sept 22,2011 thinking I was going to get it as soon as it was released. Guess what? It's Oct 3rd and and I'm still waiting. Will update review as soon as get the movie. Update: Finally arrived 4:30pm Oct, 3rd."
1,"I saw this movie in 3-D: I really don't think I would buy the blu ray dvd movie, but when I saw it at an IMAC theater in 3-D, it was increadable. That's the only way to see this movie. Without the 3-D effects, it's not that great."
1,"Following in Peter Jackson's foot prints?: This pisses me off,what a burn! I knew this came out in theaters in 3D. You find in the case a coupon for the 3D version coming out ""Soon!"" Bite me Paramount. I'm taking this back for my money. Keep the coupon. What am I suppose to do with this combo after I buy the next? You and Peter Jackson must share the same marketing people."
2,"GOOD PURCHASE!: I love this purchase and I would recommend it to any one to purchase this item for their fun and excitement!"
2,"It's ""OK"" but not as good as the first two.: Bought it because it was part of the series and I really enjoy Shai LeBouf as an actor. Really liked him in Disturbia and in Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (although the plot of that movie was pretty lame. but that's for another review.) Disappointed with how they explained the absence of his true love, Mikeala, and why they broke up. For him to have a model as a girlfriend seemed a bit of a reach. She lacked the toughness that spurred the character of Sam (Shai) to do great things. This movie is on a scale of 1-10 about a 4 for story line and a 7 for action. I still bought it but am kinda disappointed."
2,"awesome movie: This is a great addition to any DVD collection. I would highly recommend this DVD for anyone who likes this TV series."
2,"transformers: really great movie packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don't get bored or tired of watch it always something happening"
2,"A simple question......: I have a question for the continuity people.....I liked the rest of the movie, but was upset to see one thing.....why is ""Eagle's"" ascent stage still on the moon when the autobots go to visit the wreckage? I mean, come on, guys....any 60's space buff would have noticed that error...."
2,"Excellent movie at an excellent price!: Got this at a great deal and loved the movie. It's nice that I can watch it on my iTouch anytime and not on Flixster under restrictions."
2,"3d version info: Both the French and German Amazon site have the 3d Blu-Ray edition to be release in February 2012 , One has the 9th, the other has the 15th."
2,"potty mouth: great movie, but too much sweraing in it!great action screanes, are they giong to bring back megatron as galvatron we should also see unicron"
1,"Ten Minutes of Action, Five Minutes of Drama, Two Hours and Twenty Minutes of Awkward Teenage Angst: I won't say that this movie doesn't have its moments, just that they are few and far between. And you know those horrible, horrible memories everyone grows up with, the kind that scream ""embarrassment"" at high volume when, a few years later, you are reminded of the fact that yes, you were stupid enough to say that in front of those people? This movie is chocked full of those moments."
1,"Nothing special about the special affects: Most of the time you can't tell what you're looking at, everything is so dark and gritty. There are explosions all the time, but I'm not sure why, as nothing seems to get damaged. The Transformers are garbage. Once again, new ones are introduced with no particular reason why I should care, and the movie is quite cavalier about killing fan favorites. The plot is thin (and ridiculous) and has huge plot holes. Bad guys are bad, but the good guys aren't particularly good anymore, as there are a ton of casualties that nobody seems to care about.This movie evoked nothing but a hatred of Michael Bay."
1,"Can't believe I gave this 2 stars: I'm a huge Sci-Fi fan I'll watch almost anything once. This is one of those one watch movies. A huge disappointment and not enjoyable at all. The first half of the movie is spent trying to make you lust after Huntington-Whiteley. She is so one dimensional that she's impossible to like, let alone think she's appealing. There was zero chemistry between Huntington-Whiteley and LaBeouf. They wasted half the film trying to show how LaBeouf could be the worst bumbler of all time and how everyone knew it. Somebody in the studio obviously doesn't understand the Sci-Fi audience."
2,"Awesome: This Blue-ray has great picture and sound, plays awesome on my 46"" LED LCD. I couldn't ask for anything more."
2,"Good series ender: This was good series ender, still in line with the other two and lot's of action. New girl, cuter than Megan possibly."
2,"Good, not great 3D, but still a great movie for action: I already had the DVD version and wanted to see it in 3D. There are a few scenes where things pop out at you, but the overall depth of the video was less than what I was expecting. I'm still glad I purchased it in 3D and have watched it twice since owning it. I watched it on a LG Plasma with active 3D glasses."
2,"be trandformed: 3rd Transformer movie brilliant in 3D. The images and colours on blu ray show the movie to its full effeect. Sound on dolby digital perfect. Worth buying for a fun packed couple of hours."
2,"a great action movie: Transformers: dark of the moon arguably has the best action compare with its predecessors. However, it does have the worst story compare with the previous two movies. I praised transformers for its phenomenal graphics and computer graphics. It would definitely worth it if anyone is a fan of highly-advance sci-fiction movies."
2,"Transformers 3D: The movie was all we expected, and the 3d was just that much better. definitly worth the money. I was very pleased with my purchase."
1,"Where the hell is the 3D? Hollywood jerks: I bought a 3D TV only to find out that the selection of 3D Blu-rays absolutely sucks. Half of them are kids movies but the 3D warning says kids aren't supposed to watch 3D movies. No wonder so many people think 3D is a gimmick.The only great things about 3D so far, are some of the PS3 games.my fav right now is God Of War: Origins collectionI want in 3D now!Kung fu panda 2transformers: dark of the moonavatar - available to the public at reasonable price instead of one-hundred-sixty bucks(what a crock, can't believe such a good director sold his soul to panasonic)Wake up, hollywood.Between the economy and the lack of 3D content, I think America's going to hell. They've got their heads too far up their asses and low IQs too. The only thing America is #1 at is creating weapons of mass destruction"
1,"Rent for the kids, but DON'T buy it.: Please for the love of God, don't spend more than $1 renting this shlock from Redbox. We must, as good people, take away Michael Bay's monetary motivation for creating loud, unnecesary, incoherent, chaotic and useless trash. The first Transformers movie was great...witty, funny, character-driven and exciting. Then, taking a lesson from his shlock-meister mentor, Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay made the next two Transformers sequels in the manner of a spoiled child with WAY too much money, with a shiny new train set, smashing it all together repeatedly knowing mommy and daddy will simply buy him more. No soul. No humor. No brains. Just a mind-numbing and whirling mish-mash of metal carnage with bigger and bigger explosions. It actually hurts the eyes. You find yourself having to close your eyes to avoid a headache."
1,"Wort. Movie. Ever.: Transformers 3 is seriously a terrible terrible movie. yeah wow cool, special effects that i have seen time and time again, ridiculously long battle scenes that are so incredibly boring they literally make me fall asleep EVERY time i watch them, Terrible story, terrible plot, terrible rendition of classic characters. Why I even gave this movie a third chance is beyond me."
1,"Definitely not a recommanded to buy:: This movie is an action pack for the year, but the chapter transitions on this DVD BluRay version are not smooth with blank screens. Several features and clips were missing from the Theatre version. You would regret to have bought this version and should wait to get the later version with all the available added features."
1,"no 3D version: I`ll make it short and come to the point quickly: I think its a shame that Bay is starting milking the cow too by NOT putting the 3D version in this set. Pirates 4, Thor, Tron and so many others included a 3D version. I won`t buy this release and wait (let`s see for how long) for the 3D release. I know many of you hate 3D - I love it on my 65"" panasonic and was soooo looking forward for this. just my personal opinion..."
1,"This is actaully worse than Transformers 2? yep, I can honestly say it is.: A boring Nasa storyline that doesn't make a whole lot of sense to begin with, sam gets a new girlfriend and is trying to find a job, along the way we still have annoying charectors such as the mom, the asian guy, some dumb momments with sam and his boss. movie is too long with no story, no charector development, with no action until the last 40 minutes and this is a 2 and half hour movie. If the robots had fought on the moon I think It would have been more interesting and a different location, instead we get a main villian robot that is not memorable, a repeat of the robots fighting and causing destruction in the city. special effects are amazing but it can't save how poorly written this movie is. its all visual with no substance."
1,"I Was fooled again: After seeing Revenge of the Fallen,I thought this one would be way better,I thought they would have learned their lesson,but I was wrong.This movie is a 2 1/2 hour snoozefest.I paid 7.50 to see this,what was I thinking.Dont make the same mistake,just wait and rent it.Heres what you do.Rent it,get it home,Fastforward through the first half of the movie,also fastforward through all of the John Malkovich scenes.Then watch the second half,try to determine who the good bots and bad bots are,because theres so many its hard to distinguish.Shias new GF in this movie is super hot but thats not enough to save this movie,It will make hundreds at the box office because of Suckers like me."
1,"Quality: The HD streaming always fails...The movie itself was fun to watch and very enjoyable. It would be nice if the streaming quality held up."
2,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon DVD: I purchased 2 of this item as Christmas gifts for 2 of my grandsons. They have both watched it more than once and have thoroughly enjoyed it. I did not have any problems with my order. It was received in a timely manner, and in the condition promised."
2,"Must watch: Could not find this movie at the stores where I live, but sure found it on Amazon. This movie was a gift to my daughter for Christmas and I got it way ahead of time and she loved it."
1,"Makes a great drinking game!: Here are the rules: 1) Every time a character says or does something that's supposed to be funny but comes off completely lame instead-take a swig. 2) Every time the movie veers off into some completely random direction that has absolutely nothing what-so-ever to do with anything, take a swig. 3) Every time a transformer does a somersault or twist in the air in slow motion before attacking-take a swig. Follow these simple rules and you'll be bombed 15 minutes in. Seriously. While watching this movie I kept thinking how many millions of dollars were spent to provide us with idiotic jokes about red coffee cups in yellow rooms and effeminate assistants with Russian accents. Every time I see one of these movies, it saddens me. Given the insane visuals-tight, more serious stories could have really made this series into something amazing. Unfortunately that's not the case. At least there's no leg humping in this one. That's something I guess..."
1,"Transformers - AGAIN?: This film truly shows how filmmakers attempt to ride success. This movie is really bad. Even with some new blood (or should I say blonde) I couldn't hardly stand to finish the whole thing. But I did. What a waste."
1,"Fun movie, but not worth buying at this price--my bad!: if you are like me and like to go through specials features and ""making of"" documentary, this is not the BD to buy. This is the second time I make the same mistake. The first time I bough Avatar BD when it came out, and it only had the movie nothing else. It is a waste of BD room space to make such releases without having a single special feature. Wait for the Special Edition, full feature, BD release! The movie was fun, but this BD should have been price at $10.00 USD which is the price one pays these day to see just a movie. I will have to wait for the Special Edition, and give my copy to my young daughter who lives with her mom. As I said, the movie is fun, but not the price of this BD, and this will be the last time I make this mistake. I need to be more patient and not fill these mogul movie makers' pocket with our HARD earned MONEY. What do you think? Any opinions?"
1,"Bad Bad Bad: I enjoyed the first movie. I didn't think the second was as bad as everyone thought. Wow, this one was just atrocious. I'm not going into specifics as I'm sure the other reviews have but do not spend the $4.99 on downloading this. Wait for it to come out on HBO or whatever."
1,"Cheap, double dipping scumbags: While walking to the counter to PAY for this release, I turned it over to read what extras were included. NONE!!!!! Nothing!!!! I put it right back on the shelf. I am NOT paying full price for a bare-boned release! The greedy corporate thugs are counting on you to buy this, only to wave something a lot more enticing in front of your eyes when sales for this dwindle! Sick of these rip-off tactics!!! I have no sympathy for their loss of revenue from movie pirating! If they treated their customers with respect, perhaps the problem would not be so widespread!!!"
1,"Very Disappointing, No Special Features: There are no special features included in this version, which is a big contributing factor why I buy movies in the first place. Very annoying that this bare bones version is being sold at full price. More annoying still is the special features will probably come in the 3D version, which I do not intend on buying."
2,"Transformers 3: The delivery was prompt. The movie is an excellent source of entertainment. Action packed. I hope they make another one in a few years."
1,"Good but disappointed: I have seen four 3D movies on my new 3D TV and this one has been the least exciting as far as its 3D effects. I was disappointed. I am amending this review after watching the movie again. While I did enjoy the 3D version, I felt the 3D effects were subpar. It is still enjoyable to watch and still has the 3D perspective. They don't send things protruding out at you like other 3D movies do. It doesn't have the WOW-factor that other 3D movies have had."
2,"Autoawesome!: Haven't watched in 3d yet, but we all loved it at the movies, don't know what was up with Megan Fox picking Cowboys and Aliens over this movie. Even though it was a good movie it just didn't have that iconic childhood following to be a blockbuster. This is a must have in your collection."
1,"Terrible: This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart."
1,"I gave up after 57 minutes: Because nothing even remotely interesting happened so I decided to read a book instead (""Swimming Home"" by Deborah Levy).I'm glad I did not pay to go see this, I would have fallen asleep."
1,"awful: This is by far the worst Transformers movie that I have ever seen. I am glad I did not see this movie in the theaters nor bought this stupid movie. The scenes are so discombobulated and do not flow well together at all. The only one thing that could have deemed this movie is absent namely: Megan Fox vs. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. I keep watching this movie hoping it will get better but so far it is still awful. No more Michael Bay Transformer movies. I think the only way to redeem the Transformer name is to return to an animated movie. I recommend everyone to watch the animated Transformer movie and the original tv series released in the 80's."
2,"Best movie out the the three: Im a huge fan of Transformers since I can recall, I even have to tattoos. And the movie in 3D is awesome, I just bought a LG 47LW6500 and a 3D BD player...what else can I say"
2,"love it: I ordered this movie from Amazon in good condition. If I need any movies I will order from Amazon again."
2,"Darkness rented from Amazon.com: Excellent video, true to the Autobot story. I missed Megan Fox but her replacement was a great Actress and easy on the eyes! I hope the series doesn't loose steam and die!"
2,"Great Movie: The vendor mailed the movie quickly and it was new and the movie was great. Will order other movies from vendor."
2,"It was great!: Forget what the naysayers reviewed. It brought me back to my childhood. I thought it had a good enough plot. Action was outstanding, and Optimus Prime's voice is the same as when I was a kid some 25 years ago. Those bits of nostalgia coupled with modern day CGI fulfilled this geek. And what were you expecting Shindler's List? L.A. Confidential? The first time you saw Sixth Sense? It's mindless fun and this fanboy was all for it."
2,"Best one so far!: This is one badass movie. The cgi is spectacular. The 3d is not that great, but the action is crazy, it never stops. Cant wait for Transformers 4. Keep up the great work!"
2,"This is the version you want!: Not just because of the 3D, but because this is the version where they made an effort to optimize the picture! They released this on blu ray like like avatar was released. First they release the movie without any optimization and special features. Which means the picture looks better than DVD but not the best that blu ray can be.(which means a grainy looking picture that looks like the characters are in a sandstorm and there is a lack of detail that you expect in a blu ray). The they make the limited edition which is made the way a blu ray is supposed to be down. So if you are wondering which one to choose, this is the one you want! All the features with the visuals to boot!"
2,"Epic: I love this movie and I love this franchise. Each movie keeps getting better and better. I'm glad the got rid of Meaghan's Fox."
1,"It's ok...: Not much of a plot differance from the 2nd one... I saw them film in Chicago in 2010... That was the only cool thing about this movie, the Chicago back drop... Other then that don't buy this unless you saw it and liked it.. If you haven't seen it just rent it!!!!!"
2,"good: I thought it was a good movie. I grew up watchig transformers. Its nice to see it brought to the big screen."
1,"Great Visuals / Terrible Script: Glad this was free on Amazon Prime. Good effects, terrible plot.It was such a departure from the first two. I won't ever turn a movie off but this was as close as it gets."
1,"One bad movie: Just when I thought it couldn't get much worse than Revenge of the Fallen...I watch Dark of the Moon. The cheesey (and canned) music score. The overused panning camera shots with a low sun hanging just over the horizon. The also overused helicopter shots. The nonsensical and unending action sequences that leave anyone with a modicum of logic scratching their head in bewilderment (and mild disgust). The inept plot. Shia LaBeouf screaming and overacting. Hot model running around death and destruction in high heels. The endless stream of former A list actors showing up. Etc.This movie is another train wreck. Thank god I streamed it using Prime and didn't pay for it in the theater or on DVD.Ugh."
1,"Really Really Bad!: This is an awful franchise and this could be the worse of the bunch. This film is too dumb for adults and way to crass for children. I don't know who's giving the good reviews, it must be highly paid movie industry workers. This movie is really, really bad!"
1,"Horrible: It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad."
1,"Yawn: 30 minutes into it and I'm bored out of my mind. Woe is me ""hero"", terrible acting, yes it's an action movie, so let's see some action, don't try to wow me with dialog. If you're looking for something to grab your attention, this isn't it. Thankfully I didn't have to pay for the movie."
2,"Fun movie: In past Transformers movies, I couldn't make out the autobots vs decepticons in the battle scenes, but this one seemed to do the job a lot better."
2,"Great Movie: I wouldn't have purchased this movie if I didn't like it, so obviously its a great movie. Hardly even miss Megan Fox. Great special effects, great action, funny."
2,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Great entertainment. The 3rd Tranformers is not as good as the first, but MUCH better than the 2nd. My family enjoyed very much. Equally action-packed."
1,"cool robots bad acting sloppy story: The Decepticons play the Autobots like a used violin and demostrate Cybertron's AI still has a long way to go. While LaBeouf and Turturro act as if this movie is their character's last episode --- and they really over-act in this movie which is lacks the charm of the original TV cartoon."
1,"horrible: i want the 150 minutes of my life back. this is my first probably last movie review. this move was so bad it motivated me to take the time to do my fair share of trashing it a bit"
1,"Transformers: Dark of the Moon: Pretty violent, and I did not appreciate the strong language (cursing). Not suitable for my four year old to watch."
1,"Terrible plot, interesting effects.: I'm a big fan of Transformers going back to the 1980s cartoons. This movie, like all the other recent ones, do a major disservice to the franchise. But at least it looks good while doing it."
1,"One of the Worst Works of Mankind: If you've been wondering if our species is ascending or declining watch Transformers. If you haven't been wondering, I would like to take this opportunity to pose an ironic question, ""What is it like to be mindless?"""
1,"Wow this is bad!: If your 10 years old, then perhaps this is one of your very ""bestest"" films ever.......but other than that, this is close to being un-watchable for the rest of us. I only viewed it because of Spielberg's direction, but even he couldn't save this pathetic, phony, ridiculous movie. Just not for any person that actually thinks......or even smarter than average cats, dogs or monkeys. Total waste of time."
1,"Very dissapointing for Blu-ray and 3D!: This movie overall was disappointing. I so liked the first two that I really wanted this one in 3D. This was by far the worst 3D movie I have purchased. The flying paratroopers is the only reason to see this in 3D. This movie as like a very bad opera - it just went on and on and on and on ... so that when it did end you were so thankful it finally got to the inevitable conclusion."
1,"Movie was great!. If the movie was actually in the case!!!!: I had placed a huge order for my children for christmas. I was so upset when my children got the movie and there was no disc at all. so my bad review is with the company not with Amazon since they were kind enough to fix this problem and send another movie free of charge and free of shipping!! Thak you!"
2,"Best Trans yet: This film drags in a few spots but its worth the waiting. This sequel has the most amazing effects of all of the Transformers. Plus it has a great storyline."
1,"Too Chaotic: Although the modern Transformer series has incredible special effects, a movie needs more than that. The Transformers we new when we were younger were different, openly honest and strictly adhering to moral standards; but with the newer version,even the Good ones seem to be a bit more sinister and we're not always certain that they are on our side. The transformation sequence is extremely confusing and hard to follow, unlike the simpler older style. I do not like many movies these days because Hollywood seems bent on reinventing the legend of whatever character or franchise they take on, for their own purposes. There is some of that here. With some unnecessary bathroom humor as well. Strictly for special effects fans only."
1,"More of the same bad script writing: They should have stopped after the first film. More bad acting filled in with fighting sequences that are way too long."
1,"Well no.: Cheesy, rushed and too much Shia. Bay's twist on this is not liked by me and much better could have been done. But what do I know? The animated movie was excellent compared to this crap and even the games War for Cybertron and the Fall of Cybertron make this movie look bad. Action parts were ok."
1,"Terrible science, terrible acting, terrible dialogue, terrible plot: I grew up on transformers and, quite frankly, the 15 seconds of 'me grimlock' overheard in 'the Professional' had more going for it than ANY of these terrible terrible movies."
1,"Dark Day On The Moon: I have always had a problem understanding how anything which causes the degree of destruction as does the transformers can be of any merit for the planet. Then there is Shia, he makes me want to hurl every time I see him in these roles. The last thing I liked him in was HOLES."
2,"Great Movie: Great movie, however DVD does not have any features. I am not sure if it worth to pay for the price, maybe wait till you can get it on sale."
1,"Extremely repetitive, needed a haircut: I mean, 2.5 hours? Really? The story line is so simple, this could easily have been a taut 90 mins and we all would have been a lot happier. I actually have not seen the first two in this series, so this only starts to make some limited sense after a long while. Anyone should be able to watch, though, and get it, thus the editing here needed more work. The absurdly plumped up lips of the girlfriend continuously transfixed me, way more than the silly transformer action fight sequences. Speaking of which, that is where all the fat is here. The fighting could have been seriously cut and no one would have complained except maybe the kids who made this comic book movie. Is anyone surprised to learn that the bad guys/good guys theme ends with the good guys in charge, yet again?"
2,"Dark Side of the Moon: I'm a huge fan of Transformers - couldn't wait for this to come out on blu-ray so I could see all the captivating colors of the autobots - as only blu-ray can! Special effects are amazing, however the story line is weak compared to the first two movies. I was a little disappointed by the story and this is my least favorite installment. Still, if you are a fan as I am, it's a must have to make the collection complete."
2,"Great Movie!!: I could watch this movie over and over and over again. The graphics were totally awesome. A must see for all."
2,"Graphics and Shia: Definitely is a trilogy. BUT guys its superb in its delivery graphically and Shia is just simply a good actor. More diverse roles he needs, yet ifthe movie was to be watched without biasses or even the knowledge-base of the past two movies the movie would rate 4 stars.Needs more distinguished and 'heavier' plot... so not 5 stars ie as an individual film).I'm being honest on the specific film here. In reference to its repetition of sequences andthe plot generality, the 'trilogy' per say is well ... a more critical discussion.Sticking with the one movie in crit! d"
1,"it works....i guess: This thing works sometimes, and its cheep. Other then that I don't have much good too say about it. It uses up the ink in the expensive cartridges like water. And is so noisy it sounds like a truck going off road. I've owned quite a few cheep HP ink jet printers, and I've been disappointed by them all. I am going with Epson or paying a little more for a higher model HP. In the print world, you get what you pay for and buying cheep is a bad idea."
1,"Good prints... bad compatibility: I've had the P1000 for a couple of years. Worked great with WindowsME. After installing XP on my desktop I had to reinstall the printer software to get it to work. Just got a new laptop and it doesn't work at all.. in fact, the P1000 causes my Dell Inspiron to crash whenever I disconnect the USB cable. When the cable is connected the laptop never recognizes the printer."
1,"bad usb connection on P1000: I really liked this printer when I first got it about 3 years ago. Sure it was loud and a little slow, but it printed pretty good. Well, after about 1 1/2 years of VERY light duty, I all of a sudden start getting error messages on my PC telling me the printer is not connected to the computer. First I changed the cord to no avail, then I tried different open USB ports on my computer, so it ends up I just have to position the USB cable perfectly to the back of the P1000 to get it to work. At least it would still work, right? Well that got me by for about six months and now it just will not connect at all. Now my HP P1000 has a nice new home in the trashcan and I'm giving Canon a try. If HP puts as much thought into printers as they do computers I definetely don't want to buy another HP product again..."
2,"Great Photos: This printer will do everything that you would want from a low cost high output machine. The HP 1000 is the best in the photo series and I would recomend this printer to all my friends.Try it, you will like it, like all HP products."
2,"When you need a safety pin...: We are organizing our costume stock and large quantity safety pins are in big demand. Wish this came in a larger quantity, but they do serve the purpose."
2,"Yep, they are safety pins: How do you review pins? They arrived as shown. They pinned my bedskirt to the box springs. I have no complaints/"
1,"Cheap metal: It all depends on your purpose for these safety pins. I needed them for holding Velcro in place as the Velcro was pulling apart too easily. These safety pins bent as I tried to stab them into the material. The point is sharp, but the surface is rough. This rough point causes the material to cling to the safety pin rather than allow the pin to pass through easily.I would recommend the Dritz Quilter's Safety Pins. They are Nickel plated which makes them smooth and rust resistant."
2,"My favorite!!: I collect Jim Shore cats, and I have to say that this one is just amazing. The colors are so beautiful. The figurine is also quite large. Such a great purchase! Buy it, you won't regret it!!!"
2,"Great backpack and a great value!: My son was in need of a sturdy bookbag. Rather than buy another inexpensive one that would surely fall apart, I sought out something more durable. I saw this JanSport bag in a local store and thought it was perfect! It was roomy enough for all his books, was well-made with strong and sturdy fabric and had awesome cushioned straps! Problem was, it was more than I was looking to spend.I did an online search and was amazed to find the very same bag on Amazon for less than half the price! I jumped on it. The backpack arrived within days and my son LOVED it. He claims it's so much more comfortable to carry his books now.Again, an awesome product at a rock-bottom price! Thanks Amazon."
1,"Retarded: This is essentially a live action G.I. Joe film for people with IQ's below 85. I walked out after about 5-10 minutes. I changed the ticket over to Jackass 2 and laughed harder than I have in years during a movie."
2,"Best movie ever!!: This movie kicks a** all the way and I can't wait for this to come out on DVD because it's an excellent movie!"
1,"Just a wanna be Rambo: If you are looking for a movie with bad acting-cliche lines-and never gonna happen action sequences this is the movie for you! Otherwise, I wouldn't even waste a Netflix rental on it."
1,"An insult to marines: As soon as this movie started and I saw ""WWE"" on my TV screen I said ""This is gonna suck."" And it didn't disappoint. This movie sucked! Bad! It was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. The story didn't make a lick of sense. You got these bad guys who kidnap a random woman whose husband turns out to be Rambo. The marine chases after these guys, killing them one by one. You'd think they'd just give him back his wife. She means nothing to them. Give her back and they can go on with their criminal business. But no. They hold on to her.The marine runs/jumps in slow motion away from explosions at least 4 times in this movie. This movie is filled with every single action movie clich̩ and it didn't thrill in the slightest. It wasn't even bad enough to be good. It was just bad. It stunk."
1,"Maybe 2 1/2 stars.: For Cena's first movie, it was okay. Lot's of explosives but I really wouldn't recommend the movie. Some okay jokes, and the story line was kind of weak. Typical ransom, give me back my wife type of movie. I recommend that you wait till the movie comes on television, and then decide if you want to buy it or not."
2,"The great Robert Patrick: It's back to the good old days.The action packed Schwarzennegger films where the kill-shot reigns with side-splitting dialogue.Problem is! Robert Patrick is the star. John Cena makes a credible Arnold but Mr. Patrick does a wonderful villain. He's got the lines and he's nailed the perfect bad guy with a flair that would make Hannibal Lecter cringe. A great job by the former star of The X-Files who made John Doggett a memorable experience.Action and blowup sequences are A-1 all the way.The perfect film for escapist violence."
1,"Even Robert Patrick couldn't save it: I gave this movie a chance because Robert Patrick was in it. He couldn't give it any justice at all. The action was over the top and unrealistic. The criminals were all cliched especially the African-American criminal. (Don't know why they always have to make African-American characters have a smart mouth, it's too stereotypical) John Cena can't act his way out of a paper bag and he's too damn bulky with his cucumber fingers. The car chase scene with all them bullets hitting the car and Cena is still driving and able to avoid every single bullet. He's hit with multiple objects but still no mark on him. The wife gets knocked the hell out so many times but no bruise on her at all. This movie was ridiculous don't waste your time unless you're a Cena mark."
1,"Anyone Who Gave This More Than 3 Stars...: ...is a lie and the truth isn't in them!!This movie was awful. From begining to end. Even the title didn't match. Marine? He was a Marine for all of 5 minutes of the movie!! LOL. But that isn't the worse part.The acting was terrible. Even the good actors (Robert Patrick) played terrible roles. The plot was unbelieveable, the action was unbelieveable, and the comedy was corny. I think the problem was the script itself, but I think GOOD ACTING could have pulled it off.As always I encourage people to see it, but don't spend your money on it. It's garbage."
1,"The Few, The Proud, The Marines: Oh boy, it seems we have a wannabe Rambo in the house! Seriously this is one of those movies that you gotta watch to laugh at. The movie does have a lot of action scenes,stuff blowing up, people dodging bullets. and none of them are realistic. The good thing this movie boosts is that it doesn't take itself seriously. It has a few of lame one liners, it even breaks the third wall in one sceneThe movie tells the story of a recently discharged marine; he arrives home to begin a new life with his wife. They decide to take a road trip, have a good time together, but his wife gets kidnapped oh noo! Yeah so now Mr. Marine must save her. In the process he beats a lot of bad guys. Anyway it's an okay movie to watch when there's nothing on the teliMY PERSONAL RATING: 2 OUT OF 5"
1,"unvoluntarily ridiculous: Keep your hands of this movie, it definitley aint worth watching.The story is thinner than a crack ho on her last day on earth, unvoluntarily ridiculous and so placatively wanna-be-patriotic that homeland security shines outta your butt when ya bother watching this crappy movie.One of the worst movies i ve seen in years."
1,"I know John!! Son went to High School with him!!: I did not like it very much...bought it because of the fact that my son went to high school with him and thought it would be nice to have. It was not as much action as I thought it would be....a little dull...but not bad for his first...know he will get better as the ""Rock"" did!!!"
1,":0( BOOO!: first the acting was so so so bad the movie, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort."
1,"Action: Lots of action, but totally unbelievable, just like watching wrestling. Amusing enough to watch but not to own."
1,"this movie is uber lame!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! & uber boring!!!!!!: this movie stinks i hate this movie and this movie has ripped off rambo yes this movie ripped off rambo this movie stinks the director the producers the actors and actresses all stink!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! this is easily one of the worst movies ever made!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Laughably stupid: I gave this movie 1 star for only one reason Kelly Carlson is beautiful,other than that the movie goes as follows,marine gets dishonorably discharged and seems to be ok with it,wife gets kidnaped,he gets beat up,knocked out several times,gets burned,blown up,by the most overdone explosions and walks away without a scratch,this movie is pure hollywood,it was a waste of money and time,you really have to wonder if the producers ever spent any time in the military,I have never met a marine worth his salt that had to go telling everyone (Im a marine), every soldier I have ever known that talks like that was always in some bar fight or some other altercation with someone,It was a laughably stupid movie"
1,"One of the worst movies ever: Hey Im open to wrestlers acting in movies. The Rock is doing it, Hogan did it for a bit. I did enjoy wwe's other movies but this...this was just plain bad. Cena has to be one of the worst actors to ever get a starring role in a movie released in theaters. Attack of the show's Chris Gore put it at best when he said that they tried to hide the bad acting with a bunch of explosion and action. The storyline itself was bad because well it has already been done a million times before. A guy's girlfriend/wife is kidnapped and he tries to get her back. WWE could have easily found someone better. Skip this movie. In fact do someone a favor, buy the dvd and destroy it so no one would have to witness this horrible movie. I would give it a 0 if I could. Nothing about this movie is good"
1,"what a waste: john cena has to be the worst actor in history, wiht corny quote and stare one after another, it just shows how fargone the world of film has become, i honestly cant belive how people can pay for this. not only is john cena annoying his acting is unbearable, its worse then wacthing george bush's innauguration...dont buy it, your waisting your money, its a joke, i honestly dont get how someone could watch him unless ypu think he attractive, which unless you like people who act what their not, then he's ur type john cena is the worst thing to happen to wrestling"
2,"We loved it!: My family watched the movie and loved it. It was exactly what we were looking for.....John Cena action flick to escape reality for a little while. Can't wait til his new movie comes out in March."
1,"Typical action film with strange attempt at humor: This is a typical action film with lots of fight scenes and gun fights but little logic. It's amazing that hundreds of bullets can be fired at point blank range with no one getting hit and people getting hit in the face with fire extinguishers, pieces of wood and other objects without so much as a scratch. And then there are people surviving incredible explosions, again without getting so much as a hangnail. The directors attempt at moments of humor failed miserably. They were not only not funny but were very wierd to me.I enjoy watching John Cena in action, just as Arnold Schwarzenegger was fun to watch, but this movie just didn't impress me anymore than wrestling does. I think one star out of five was being too generous."
1,"Mildly entertaining at best: This movie had bad acting and a thin plot. Could have been much better. Lots of action, lots of explosions but didn't seem like a good Blu-ray quality movie. It killed 2 hours but nothing i would recommend to a friend to watch."
1,"Ha-Ha-Ha...: If the cover for this low-brow action piece wasn't a hint, then you're probably one of the producers target audience. One of the things I think hurts hollywood is its irrepressible desire to shove the American flag down our throats by making these ""patriotic"" movies. We have the American flag, Iraq, marines... and wrestling!!! I guess if cow-tipping is a hobby you enjoy as much as practicing a suplex, then this movie is for you.As for a review, it stank. If you see it on the shelf of your local video store, leave it there.If you're a hollywood producer, please stop making movies starring wrestling ""stars"". If your name is Hulk Hogan, Steve Austin, John Cena (The Rock is OK) please stick to your day jobs."
1,"Don't waist your money on this: This movie was a joke, a bad actor, and a bad story, makes it look like the Marine Corp gung ho killers."
2,"lots of action~caution on the language: This movie has a lot of action, and my husband loved it. I do, however, warn you about the language. I wouldn't have any underage viewers present if you watch, and the language even made me want to leave the room, but if your okay with that, the movie is very action-packed."
2,"For hard core action fans.: This is one for the hard core action fans. There's very little 'down time' to run for popcorn. If someone isn't getting shot, punched, etc. things are getting blown up or sunk in water. There is an action scene I haven't seen yet with a police car. Several of the action scenes are worth a rewind and I did appreciate the 'buff bodies'. You have to give these guys an A plus for working out.Chrissy K. McVay - Author"
1,"Marine Comedy: This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh."
1,"If bogus got stars, this would have 10: As an ex-marine I can tell you that the only shred of realism in this thing was the marine being punished for doing well. He can afford a nice house and a new Lincoln Navigator on peon pay. He chases his wifes kidnappers thru a construction zone at 100 MPH, endangering everybody instead of just laying back and using the radio to tell the cops where to put a roadblock. He gets hit in the head with enough stuff to start a junkyard but never shows a mark, gets blown up at least twice without being even singed. The HiPo Camaro takes dozens of hits but they all miss the radiator, tires, electrical and fuel system. Not for anybody older than 10. It did have nice explosions, though."
1,"new answer to the question ""What the worst movie next to Missing in Action I""?: This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life."
2,"Non-stop action from beginning to end!: I was skeptical of this movie featuring a WWE wrestler (WWE wrestlers are notoriously bad actors) and because the movie was produced by the WWE rather a than a major motion picture company. However I was wrong. The movie was full of action and special effects. John Cena did a respectable job acting. The theme and plot were very entertaining, not cheesey or bogus. If you like action movies such as ""Arnold"" movies or Rambo movies then you will very much enjoy this movie!"
2,"Not a bad movie: To be honest , I gave it 4 stars but it's more like a 3 1/2 simply because it does have it's good points to it .This film take's us back to the ""later 80's action film ara"" and can be compared to some of Steven Sagals films , or even Dulf Lungren.I just can't get over the fact that it's John Cena in this film (and that's not really a good thing) His acting was OK and the action was good , but it's no ""Condemed"" with Stone Cold !In short , it's OK and that's about it . It will entertain and it isn't a waste of money or time .3 1/2 Stars"
1,"Painful to watch...: I watched this movie for some sign of a redeeming quality; and found none. The acting was terrible, the action scenes were dramatically staged and unrealistic, no plot, and they didn't even try to make it humorous. If you watch the special features, they beat the living daylights out of the main character who got injured numerous times during the creation. I felt bad for him because he was really trying. If they had a halfway decent director or photographer, they could have used this guy's effort and hard work to make a good movie. If you want to watch a good B action movie, rent Equilibrium or Dark City. Skip this one."
1,"Bad...: ...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."
1,"made me ashamed to have served: This is the first time that I've ever felt so compelled to write a review for a movie I thought was horrible. But this movie is that bad.I can't believe someone actually enjoyed this.The one liners, and that whole rock candy thing??? What was that all about? Was that supposed to be funny?Who wrote this anyway? He should be tried in a criminal court for waisting my money and my time.The acting was also some of the worst I've seen. I will never be able to watch Terminator 2 again.Oh, the explosions were impressive. Maybe if you took away everything but the explosions it wouldn't be too bad.Thanks. I feel a little ""dumber"" for having sat through the whole thing."
2,"Awesome: I only went to this see this movie because i love john cena and hes sooo HOT. I dont like action movies AT ALL and my husband has to beg me to watch them. But this movie was incredibly awesome. It had me on the seat of my chair from beginning to end. Excellent job john triton."
1,"MAKES THE RAMBO SEQUELS SEEM LIKE CITIZEN KANE!: I have to say this movie is beyond ridiculous! When watching an action movie like this, one should have an open mind and realize that this is a fatasy world, but....... ""The Marine"" is summed up in one sentence in the film. As one character says to Robert Patrick's character(who starred in T2 Terminator 2)and says this guy is like the Terminator!.......That was the funniest line in the movie, but this guy isn't the Terminator and he escapes too many sure deaths for me to take this movie any more serious than an old Looney Tune cartoon! The acting is terrible and the characters are not intersting.....in short...this movie SUX!"
1,"The missing songs...: Nero from NYC - you're absolutely right: unfortunately the best songs of the film are not included on this soundtrack. These are 'Hell', 'Sailors' and 'Whore' performed by the wonderfully strange band ""The Tiger Lillies"" from London, all available on their own CDs... Not really Zydeco, but great stuff, nevertheless!"
1,"Great score, terrible quality: The music on this album could be incredible.However, there is low-level line noise on every track, the audible range of the tracks seems like it's been ""chopped"", making all the tracks sound ""muddled."" One track should flow seamlessly to the next, but the mastering between tracks results in extreme volume level changes.I am by no means an audiophile, but the MP3 quality for this album is just terrible. (I don't know if the same mastering issues exist for the cd version of this album)."
2,"Nice: This CD is the epitome of good soundtrack music. You'll get a variety of good music in this album. Definitely recommended."
1,"Where is the music from the film that I bought this cd for?: I enjoyed the film and purchased the cd in search of the Zydeco song ""Your going to Hell"" but alas although it was the most pumping song in the whole film they left it off the sound track! Does anyone know the name of the song that I'm talking about and where can I find it?"
1,"Not satisfied with this item!: We ordered this plaque as a house warming gift. We were under the impression based on the photo, that the plaque would be able to be hung on the house. When we received the item, not only was the number of the house not in the center, like pictured, but it came with 2 steaks to be inserted into the ground, with no way to hang it on a house. I understand it says ""lawn"" in the title, but it is clearly pictured hanging on stone. I contacted Shopzeus stating that the number was not in the center and it couldn't hang on a house. They sent a new one, with the number in the center, but still unable to be hung on the house! I contacted Shopzeus again and asked for either a full refund or a plaque that can be hung on the house. It has been over 2 weeks and they have not answered my email. This item is very misleading and should not be pictured as it is, if it can only be used in the lawn. I am extremely dissatisfied with this product and would never buy from Shopzeus again."
1,"Disappointing on several levels: There is only a brief introduction to the images and the period this coloring book covers. That was one star off. However, we do need to keep in mind that this is supposed to be a coloring book, target audience probably children though frankly I know many adults who adore these sorts of books. The images however not simple black and white lines drawings but have shading and that interfers with coloring. Also many of the images are ""blurry"" or so details that I don't think it is much fun to color. But it could be a cool reference for clip art or examples of the gothic style."
1,"heavily inked in plate repros of circa 1875 designs: Almost useless as a true coloring book due to the heavily inked in gothic designs. Some of the designs are highly detailed and intricate, yet totally useless because most of it is inked in already. The entire book consists of gothic clip art style 1875 ink-plate repros of gothic pillars, gothic crown molding, etc. The images are printed back to back on quality white stock paper, however, markers bleed through. NO limited recopy rights at all, not even for our own use. Not even just to recopy so we can use markers. The price does not justify the product at all.This is not a Dover Publication, it was published by Stemmer House Publishers. Best to stick with Dover, at least with Dover you know you're getting top quality in all aspects."
2,"Dorothy TumbiUmbi: When I was young Lorne Doone was set for our final year. I never fininhed reading or did I like it. This time I found it a very good and well written, enjoyed and liked it very much. A fine picture drawn of life in hard situations hardly comprehended in our modern existant. Well worth reaading this book. Thank you Amazon."
2,"One of the Most Romantic Stores Ever!: It's a love story, and it has everything: bandits, highwaymen, corrupt judges, criminal masterminds, heroes, villains, faithful friends, lovers, betrayals, robbery, murder, mines, runaway carriages, and beer for breakfast. It's written in classic 19th-century prose style, so don't be put off by the slow start. Slog through it, tough it out, fall it love with the great John Ridd and the beautiful robber's child, Lorna Doone. Set in Exmoor, it's based on historical events. The Ridd farmhouse exists to this day. Lorna Doone is a must read for everyone, at least once in a lifetime."
2,"Lorna Doone - a Classic !: I was pleasantly surprised to find this book so readable- even by modern standards it is a good read, although the language in parts is somewhat old-fashioned, archaic even ..... but if you can deal with that, this is a good bet for anyone who would like a tale of England in the late 1600's... love, adventure, and even a little humor too!"
2,"Lorna Doone: I bought this book for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it"
2,"An all-time favorite.: I first read this book when I was a child. It has always been one of my favorites. I cannot tell you how many times I have read Lorna Doone but I love it more each time."
1,"Driver Support: No Mac support. Boooo Hissss!No Win95 support? GOOD! Why are you still running that outdated OS anyway? At least upgrade to Win98."
1,"Problems installing software, weak tech support.: When I run the software installation, it loads it's two executable files into my startup directory. This shouldn't happen.When I try to launch the emarker software, it says ""Cannot initialize encryption, Application shutting down"".I e-mailed their tech support for some ideas and the responder said they didn't think the software would work with Win98SE. ?????"
1,"Venus Fly Trap: I got one of the earliest examples of these new devices. They are simple to install and fairly simple to use. In essence, you put it on your keychain, and anytime you hear a song you like (and perhaps want to buy), you hit the button. Then, you attach it to your computer via the cradle, log on to Sony's eMarker website, and by selecting your city and station (you must remember what station you were listening to when you hit the button), it checks the time stored in the unit against the playlist supplied to the Sony website from each radio station. You can get some info on the song/artist, hear some clips, and if you're so-inclined, you can buy the complete song from Sony via download. This is a 'free service', unless you decide to buy the music. In that sense, the eMarker is a clever tool for Sony to sell direct-to-consumer, avoiding the other means of internet distribution now available, as well as circumventing the retailer."
1,"Do not buy: Save your money. It's pure hype. If you listen to more than one station, you have to wade through several audio clips to figure out which one you liked. If you listen to anything but pop, it's useless. It's just a gadget to get you to buy CD's through their web site."
1,"New Technology Needs Help: The Sony eMarker is an awesome idea, but understand that it is nothing more than a stopwatch that depends on data from a website powered by Sony and Broadcast Data. This information seems to need some help, as the ""24 Hour"" wait for playlist updates is sometimes taking 5 days. The product is cool, but Sony needs to keep their end of the deal and update the website... I'd wait for a few months before buying another one so that Sony can iron out the bugs."
1,"Worthless Gadget: Great idea or so I thought. I fell for the marketing hype. This little gadget is nothing more than a time stamp. You plug it in and it reads the time stamp and shows you what was playing on the radio station that you pre-selected when you registered on the web. If you were listening to a different station, you have to look it up on their site, which defeats the purpose of this thing. You can already look up songs on the net without this gadget. In fact, you can do it better without the gadget, because, emarker's coverage is limited (No AM, jazz, classical, or music videos). Save your money!"
1,"The $20 stop watch: Before you buy this thing, understand one thing. When you mark a song, you have to remember the station you were listening to at that time. So if you have 10 emarks, you have to remember the station you were listening to at the time of each of the emarks. I wondered about this detail before I bought the thing and found no mention of it anywhere on their website. I assumed it would mark the station somehow. My mistake. Learn from it."
1,"It only remembers the time, not the station.: Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a ..clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
1,"Useless!!: I was sold this item only to learn, after opening the corresponding Web site necessary for eMarker function, that Sony was terminating the corresponding Web service in 45 days!!A great idea but no support."
1,"Perfect Idea but just not ready: The eMarker is a wonderful and innovative idea. The size is right and the price is reasonable (a little cheaper would be nice, but its acceptable). The big problem stems from the fact that Sony has no Mac support... or support for a number of other platforms as well. It's not like its hard to make the eMarker compatible with these systems. Sony is only shooting themselves in the foot. If this product were to support the Mac, it would be a 4 or 5 star product."
1,"emarker.com to shut down 9/30/2001: Do not buy the emarker. It is being shut down by Sony on 9/30/2001. I received the following email from emarker.com on 9/5/2001:We will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01.To keep your eMarks information, just print the screens from your eMarks pages.For eMarker refund information, please click here.(emarker.com)Thanks for your support.The eMarker Team"
1,"Good if you listen to ONE radio station at all times!: I live in Phoenix, AZ and we have quite a few radio stations that are listed with E-marker. The main problem is that you have to wait 24 hours before the radio and song information is updated on E-marker's web page. Also, if you listen to more than one station it becomes a problem to remember what station you were listening to at the time you heard the song and pressed the E-marker. Trust me, it is hard to remember which one of your 3 listed radio stations you were listening to, especially if it was more than 24 hours ago - I thought the whole point behind this product was to let you not remember!"
1,"Good idea, needs LOTS of work: The set up is real easy, the site is too flashy (no pun intended) and the play lists are never updated. I have NO idea what the other people who give this good reviews are thinking. I live in NYC, media capital of the world, and if it doesn't work here with hip-hop and Latin stations, it won't work anywhere. If you r into Latin music the site tells you the stations are supported but when you mark a song it gives you the popular songs not necessarily the songs playing. It is very unreliable, I have yet to see it work more than 3 times, and I have owned it for well over a month. If you want to get it, DON'T. At least wait until they start working on getting the play list on point."
1,"ABSOLUTE GARBAGE PRODUCT: Do not believe any of the so-called good reviews! This product is nonsense and simply DOES NOT WORK. I was able to install it rather easily. However, the flashy sophisticated website is NEVER updated! The play list are NEVER available! I am very dissappointed in Sony. Great concept, good looking product as usual fom Sony. Typical lack of performance. My experience is 180 degrees from the good reviews and I don't believe they are real or honest."
1,"Not Needed -- Free Alterative: This was bought for me as a gift, but it is completely unneccesary. It's simply a case of a company using widely available technology to make some money off of peoples' ignorance... If I hear a song that I wonder ""...hmm, what was that?"" I simply log on to the StarCD website and choose the radio station I was listening to and the time. It uses the same data that this device does. The only thing this device does is record times. If you think its worth spending the money for a keychain timestamp-thingermajig, go ahead. Ill just jot it on my hand with a pen. (I have no commercial or otherwise affiliation with StarCD, I'm just an impressed user.)"
1,"Small Device... Huge Disappointment: When I first heard about this I was elated, no more guessing what the song I was listen to is called. Then I connected to the website. At the time I had a 28K modem. Trying to access Sony's flash-enabled site was undesirable, if not impossible. I had to wait half an hour just to figure out what a three minute song was called. Also, the fact I still had to write down the station I was listening to. Doesn' that defeat the purpose of this toy?"
1,"Not so hot...: I thought this product would be great, and help out my kids a lot!! My daughter hates it and it is so confusing. We can't find a lot of just regular songs. It is easier just to call the radio station and find out yourself."
1,"Incomplete: Nice idea, poor execution. It simply does not work well, and is therefore much more trouble than it's worth."
1,"waste of cash: This was the biggest waste of money ever created. If you want to know the song that much, call the station and ask them, they don't mind, really."
2,"great BUT: great product BUT some guy was working and going to call it the iMusic or something to work on Mac & PC but no stupid sony bought it from him now they get the money for HIS credit and its PC only I HATE THAT STUPID SONY SO NOW I NEED TO USE VIRTUAL PC! THANKS A LOT SONY,or should I say PHONY! (yes i know caps means souting)"
1,"THE WORST THING EVER CREATED: I'm sure you can see by now with everyone else's reviews that this product is garbage. Well, hey, if you pay close to nothing, don't expect anything much in return! Just save yourself the money and DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT... instead, put some gas in your car or something!"
2,"New Technology!: This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. Its new for crying out loud! The best way to get these bugs ironed out is by supporting the product and giving Sony feedback. The interface of this product is excellent and simple...a button and a tiny LCD screen. If you don't know how to use this then...technology isn't your buddy I guess. As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated. Not every location on the surface of the earth is supported (yet) but as far as I'm concerned an e-mail request to Sony could help to do the trick. Overall, the product is great and it is a great Sony investment."
2,"This thing rocks!: I got this as a Christmas gift from my boyfriend. I am not so sure what all the bad reviews are about. All I know is that the E-marker worked perfectly for me and I use it all the time. I live in Boston and the songs are very accurate. Sometimes it takes them a day or so to figure out the song (reason for 1 less star) if the song is an 80's song."
1,"Don't do it! It's still in beta...: Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true..."
1,"Great idea...bad support: I bought the Sony E-Marker because I thought it was a great idea. I am the type of person who does not remember who sings what and the title of songs. I was estatic when I received it in the mail and could not wait to start using it. To my disappointment when I went to download the driver I found out that it is only compatiable to Windows 98. I am currently running Windows ME. I tried to contact emarker for support with no luck or response. I have no idea when an update will come out so basically I have a product that I would love to use just sitting on my desk taking up space."
1,"rip off: no place in the ad does it say the use of this depends on the radio stations in your area must belong to their service for this to work none in my area of south west florida seem to least of all my favorite stations and it seems that the music you listen too must be of the lastest out or there is no info on it or where you can buy it so yes i feel like i got ripped off ... thank you sony"
1,"no more service: eMarker service will be end by the end of September.Refund service has already started.I just got the device last month and am ready to refund now."
1,"SLOW very very slow: Know this the web site for this gaget may tell you that the radio listings information is updated every 10 minutes. That was not the case with the radio stations I tried the emarker on. The only song information I could get was ""information unavaiable check back in 24 hours"". They dont even promise to have the information in 24 hours. This is not the fault of emarker my understanding is most radio stations only update their play lists every 24 hours. So the problem is the misleading information provided by the emarker site. Caution if you buy this product dont expect timely information from emarker."
2,"Good product, but not really needed by younger people: This Product is truly a great product. I found out about this a few days ago. This really is a great product, and it is easy to use, but this isn't really needed by anyone 13-24 because we regularly tune into the radio and/or watch MTV almost everyday. I could see this useful for older people, probably 40+, but it isn't really too practical for a younger generation."
1,"Discontinued by SONY: eMarker has been discontinued by Sony, here's the noticeThis is to inform you that we will be permanently closing down the eMarker.com service on 9/30/01. You will not be able to access your eMarker.com account after 9/30/01. If you have eMarks that you would like to save, simply print the screens from your eMarks pages. You will only be able to save hard copies of your eMarks information."
1,"Xenote itag was far better: Sony just stole the idea from Xenote, iTag was far better and it was Free. iTag was working and has far more station, it was so simple to use that you just needed a single plug to work. They steal idea and they are not even abble to steal it correctly. It's just a shame for a such big companie as Sony."
1,"As already stated, a good idea with a lousy execution: I often listen to the radio and don't know what songs are called so I could download em. I saw an advertisement for this product, and decided to try it out. Everything went well until the first time I uploaded the emarks. For some reason 3 or 4 of each song was comming up. I deleted them, but was unable to delete the emarks on my emarker. I was very dissapointed in this product, espically the software and I strongly dissuade you from buying it."
1,"CAREFUL! SONY rips you off!: I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-("
1,"Does what it says, BUT. . .: This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review. Current users are being offered a refund, but my guess is if you buy one now you won't get that.I'd write more detail, but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks. :("
1,"eMarker shutting down 30th September 2001: Check their web site at www.emarker.com. A pity. This looked like a good idea. :-("
1,"It only remembers the time, not the station.: Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you"
1,"Terrible: I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK."
1,"Challenging: This unit is quite difficult to use. The button is very sensitive, which sometimes causes false entries. The website is complicated to use. I think with a little work E-marker will be a good product to have."
2,"Sony EMarker: A great way to find new music.: I just got the emarker, and right away i love it. It is small, cute and it fits right into your USB port. You dont even need the cradle.The negative parts are that you have to remember which station you marked on if you listen to more than one station, but i dont so its not a preblem for me. Another problem is the space, but thats easy because you can just go online and upload them, and free up your space. One really cool thing about it is that you can mark songs from covered TV stations, or mark songs when you are out of town. Overall, its a really great and smart product and its really easy to use! I give it 5 stars because the cons aren't worth fretting over. I am a satisfied customer."
1,"Out of Business: These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer."
1,"WASTE: its unbelievable to me that you still have this available to purchase. After 9/30/01, you cannot use this, so why is it on sale still? and why is it going off the market? Its a great idea, I hope someone else picks up where sony leaves off."
2,"I love my Sony e-marker!: You do have to remember what station you were listening to but I usually only listen to three different stations and it's easy to switch between the stations on the web site. I also like the sound clip option that is available for many of the songs. If it's been a few days since I've heard the song and I'm not sure about the station I can listen to the sound clip and easily identify the song.I teach an indoor cycling class and have found this to be an invaluable tool for finding great songs!"
2,"Works on country and western stations too!: I am a country and western fan in Memphis. This new Sony product is great! I meam really great. I don't have to remember songs I hear on the radio anymore. Definitely worth the $19.99 I paid. Get one!"
1,"Ruined by neutering the artwork: I adored these books growing up and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves for changing exactly what made them classics. I would have forgotten about them years ago if it weren't for the haunting illustrations. I took them camping, to slumber parties, they were fantastic and terrifying: which was the whole point. To be scared.I have nothing against the new artist and his work in general, but this is not the place for it. To change what made a book a classic for it's 30th anniversary is insane. I can't imagine what they were thinking.If parents are afraid their kids can't handle these books in their original form, they have simply to not buy them books that are meant to be scary or maybe, you know, flip through the book before you hand it to your child. Which is a sad thing anyway, I've seen nothing good come of raising children in a nerfed world, but still.There is no excuse whatsoever to censor such an eerie, memorable, and nostalgic children's book."
1,"Not the Nightmare-fuel from my childhood: Don't waste your time or money. Buck up and spend the extra for an original Stephen Gammell illustrated version. If you're buying it for a kid who may in fact be a total wiener, then by all means get this one. But then, why are you buying the little wiener horror stories?Stephen Gammell's version will help develop a child's hippocampus and exercise their innate terror response. This one is lame."
1,"80's and 90's children will be heartbroken...this has been completely ruined by new artwork...bring the old stuff back!: Half, maybe a bit more than half, of the fun and uniqueness of this wonderful collection was the awesome terrifying artwork...If it still had the old artwork I would definitely buy this for my future children...but alas, it has been replaced by generic boring illustrations similar to every other book...I am 20 now, but these amazing stories along with the scary artwork will always be in my memory and I remember them very fondly. they did not scar my memory or scare me to insanity. They sure were scary but not enough to completely get rid of them! I will never buy this version. I'd rather pay for a used copy of the older better version but never this one...I am kind of heartbroken they got rid of it as it was so perfect the way it was. The parents who complained about the old artwork should be ashamed."
1,"No original illustrations = garbage: This is just abysmal... Taking what was THE definitive horror trilogy for the 90s and changing the artwork because tightwad parents disapproved. Don't let your kids read the books if you don't like them, but ruining it for EVERY kid born after 2000? What a sign of the times... Family Guy/American Dad in the Simpsons spot, Twilight saga in the X-Files spot, Hunger Games sweeping Battle Royale under the rug, and now this..."
2,"holy crap.: This book was so incredibly scary. It could've been just me being scared easily, but they should change the name of tis book to ""Stories to Scare th Crap out of Kids""Seriously."
1,"These are not the Stephen Gammel illustrations!!: I was extremely disappointed when I found out about a reprinting of Scary Stories with a new illustrator. Like many adults I grew up reading these books by myself and with friends. The best part of reading these stories was turning the page to see what sick illustration was next. They creeped you out and I know I am not alone when I say that as an adult, they still creep me out. That's what is so fun about them to this day. I lament that this generation of readers will read a version of Scary Stories with watered down illustrations because uptight and squeamish parents have tried to ban these books from libraries. I have the originals and I will keep them for posterity."
1,"A watered down version of the original: I'm sure the editors at HarperCollins thought by changing the powerful (and controversial) imagery of this book, they'd sell more copies. Nothing like compromising art and expression to sell out.1/5 stars for this homogenized shadow of the original book."
1,"Worthless Edition.: Without Stephen Gammell's artwork, these are pretty close to worthless.Why would they EVER replace the original, incredible artwork? The reality is, Harper Collins, that Stephen Gammell's artwork MADE these classics.The artwork now is unoriginal, not the least bit frightening (or artful), and does nothing to complement the stories.Huge mistake. Someone should be fired. At least five people should be fired... and blacklisted.This is an atrocity.Prospective buyers: go buy the other versions! Oh, that's right, they're extremely expensive. I wonder why, Harper Collins? You fools.And again for good measure: you fools."
1,"Missing what made the original versions great: The art!: Alvin Schwartz's stories always played second fiddle to Stephen Gammell's art. Without it, this book is not worth anyone's time or money. Avoid it and seek the originals."
1,"Not the original illustrations!: Shame on Harper Collins for re-releasing these books without Stephen Gammell's artwork! These ""new"" drawings are awful and ridiculous. Buy The Scary Stories Treasury instead, as it has all the original books intact."
1,"Buy the Original Version: This version does not include the gruesome illustrations of the original that still haunt me every once in a while. The book has been controversial because of the uncensored gore and terrifying images. This version is compromised fluffy camping-trip stories."
1,"Also displeased with the new art.: As another child who was scarred by the terrifying art style in the original books, I was extremely excited to hear about the re-release of these classic stories. The books arrived today; lo and behold the original art has been replaced with bland, uninteresting art that would be better suited in an R.L. Stine novel.A wasted purchase..."
1,"NOT THE ORIGINAL ARTIST!: Because I remember loving and being absolutely terrified at these books when I was a kid, I recently purchased all 3 and just received them today. To my horror (and not in a good way) I found that they've published them with a DIFFERENT ILLUSTRATOR! With all due respect to Mr. Helmquist (the new guy) and certainly to Mr. Schwartz (the original author), these books were made for me by the art of Stephen Gammell. I'm sure they did this because so many parents tried to get the books banned in their day because of the ghastly drawings, but this is really a tragedy. I would suggest looking elsewhere for original copies of the books as they should be seen. Don't buy them here - you'll be missing out on part of what made these books so wonderful in the first place."
2,"scary: This book was great.It was scary at some points, but other times it was a little dull.They also had a wide variety of stories like the first one.They also had many new topics.If you thought the first one had scary stories ,then you should read this one."
2,"Childhood favorite, rediscovered: When I learned that they were redoing these books with new, tamed down illustrations (Google it and prepare to be saddened), I remembered how much I loved these, as a kid, a teen, and still today. I knew I had a 3 book box set somewhere, but after not being able to find it, I decided to find replacements online. After ordering, I discovered my old set, but having 2 lets me loan them out to others. These are the most fantastic horror story books for all ages, and the illustrations are truly unsettling. Prepare to be creeped out in the best way possible!"
2,"Scary stories you'll remember for years: Horrifying and haunting short stories illustrated with mentally disturbing sketches. I used to pull this book out at slumber parties and we'd all freak ourselves out. I still remember some of the short stories to this day."
2,"The best book to scare you and your friends: This book is the best book ive read in my entire life. I love the book because it has scary,funny short stories that will scare you and your friends. And the good thing about it is that it is an enjoyable book not a long boring one about one thing only. And it has really cool pictures with the story so you can know what is happening.It is easy to read and to understand the stories."
1,"Be Cautious with Young Children: This may be an awesome book for children who are not too sensitve and love to be scared. However, for the more senitive child, it can be very disturbing. A teacher read some of the stories to my 4th grader's class months ago and he is still having trouble sleeping. The pictures are what has bothered him the most. He can't seem to get them off his mind. So, be selective about with whom you share this book. You may have some unhappy parents if you choose to read it to a group."
1,"new art is garbage: This is being written mostly in protest of the re-print. The stories in these series were always a little dull. But the art, the art was fantastic, and now they've taken it away. I dont have my old copies any more and now the old books are going for outrageous sums. I wanted to get these books for my kids someday--not any more."
1,"The art is a joke: This isn't the original art for these books. They hired a cheap hack to make the illustrations ""less scary"". The original had a better artist and better illustration. Dont waste your time on this pussified version."
1,"Scary Stories that are no longer scary.: The original books contained haunting, even downright frightening illustrations that still disturb me to this day. They made these stories scary. They were original, artistic, beautiful and downright horrifying, and have been replaced by bland, boring, and shamefully dull. If you want something that will scare you, find a copy of this book with the original artwork by Stephen Gammel."
1,"These are not the books you grew up with...: Many of us remember being on a wait list at school or at our community libraries to borrow these horrifying gems. Yes, the stories themselves were spooky. Seeing some of our local folklore in print just added to the eerieness. The most important contributor to the scare-factor was the incredibly grotesque pieces of art that accompanied each story. This reprint features a new, popular artist; however, the illustrations don't have that same terror-inducing quality as before.For me, I think the reason is that there was a lot of mystery in Gammell's work, while Helquist's just doesn't leave anything to the imagination. In Gammell's work the picture is set up so that it is happening TO YOU. In Helquist's work, the perspective is such that you can see it happening to the characters. Just doesn't do it for me. You can google the images or check blogs to see for yourself."
1,"Illustrations are Terrible!: First off, I must say that I used to read these books when I was younger (even though I'm still a kid). And the stories in this book are the original great stories, but the ILLUSTRATIONS the best part of the original version, have been CHANGED. That really sucks because the new pictures are so watered down they aren't scary anymore. The new title should be Not Scary Stories to Tell in the dark."
1,"Not worth buying--BUY THE ORIGINAL!: I grew up on these books and the biggest part of their allure and charm was the nightmarish and frightening artwork by Stephen Gammell. I am EXTREMELY disappointed that they are being re-drawn with a washed out and flowered up style. Please take my advice and buy the original, it is definitely worth it, I promise. I think it is sad that some children will never know the original drawings because parents are too uptight and make a big fuss about them. Too sad. They are SUPPOSED to be scary, you know?"
1,"Another person who can't believe they changed the art.: Reading these books left a huge impression on me as a child. The tales were scary, but the original artwork was what was truly horrifying. I loved these books and was looking forward to sharing them with my children when they are old enough to terrorize.It's inexplicable that the publishers would ruin this series by changing what give it its power. Terrible mistake."
1,"Do Not Buy This Edition: Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special."
2,"A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""!: A LOT better than R.C. Welch's ""Scary Stories For Stormy Nights""! Unlike that book, these stories are original (and not sad).My favorite story is ""The Hook"", because I enjoy scary stories about serial killers, and this one, like ""High Beams"", can happen, which makes it HORRIFYING!"
2,"NIGHTMARES: YOU HAVE TO SEE HOW SCARY LOOKING THE PICTURES ARE IN ALL OF THE BOOKS!!!! THAT COULD DEFINETELY GIVE YOU NIGHTMARES FOR A WHILE.EVEN IN SOME STORIES. THERE WAS NOT A PICTURE OF THE WENDINGO, BUT THE BACK OF THE BOOK SAID IT WAS A FEMALE SPIRIT, AND/OR A CANNIBAL GIANT THAT KILLS FOR HUMAN FLESH AND ANTHROPOLOGISTS DESCRIBED INDIANS WANTING TO EAT FLESH AS A ""WENDIGO PSYCHOSIS"". {I'm sure that's how you spell that word}."
1,"Jake's: I did not like this book because it was not like a complete story. It just had little mini stories in it. I also did not like it because some of the authors who wrote the stories did not finish them. One more reason is there are a lot of pages, but it is not hard so it makes it too easy to read.The book Scary Stories is a book filled with about 10 different stories. It is very scary andit just makes you want to scream! This book will scare its reader half to death.The type of reader that would like this book is maybe someone who watches a lot of horror movies. The reason is because it really scares you. The reader would also have a strong stomach because it is a gross book."
1,"Scary when I was little, not years later.: I first found this book when i was little--and yeah, then it scared me more. I found it recently in barns and nobles, and wanted to buy it to re read it. Big mistake.This book is more hysterical than scary to me. I didn't even feel a little scared. Big disappointment for me. my advice? read it when you are younger, it might acutally be scary then."
1,"Horrified, and not in a good way: To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the ""super creepy"" pictures. Political correctness run amuck is the only explaination for the watering down of the imagery into something bland and banal. I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was."
1,"Warning for customers: Any storyteller can tell you that there's little point in telling scary stories without proper atmosphere. Scary stories are told at night around campfires or in darkness lit only by a single flashlight. When reading this book of folktales, you lose the advantage of total darkness and the timing and tone of a storyteller's voice. What made up for the lack were the strange and frightening illustrations of Stephen Gammell. This edition of the book replaces those with far tamer illustrations. Reading it now is akin to telling a scary story while sitting poolside at noon with all your buddies, there's very little impact or involvement for the reader.I hope someday that Harper Collins will bring back the illustrations that truly made these stories scary, but until then I cannot recommend this edition."
1,"This was just a mistake.: Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."
1,"Big Thumbs Down for New Illustrations: I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them."
1,"Not the book from your childhood.: Stephen Gammell's amazing and terrifying art --the most memorable part of this series-- has been stripped and replaced with generic art by Brett Helquist in this edition."
1,"Bring back Gammell: The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary."
1,"My Childhood! :(: While the stories are good, what made these books for me as a kid and most people I know was the artwork. MAN, they scared the crap out of me as a kid as well as everyone else. The new artwork is generic Harry Potter-esque and has none of the unadulterated creepiness the original one had. Get the ones with the original art folks, there is a whole new generation out there to be as freaked out as we were."
1,"Not the Best Version: While Scary Stories To Tell in the Dark is a classic children's book, DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, and find the original version with Stephen Gammell's illustrations.Alvin Schwartz's words and Stephen Gammell's drawings simply go together, and your children deserve to be treated to the full and correct experience granted by the combination of Schwartz and Gammell.Yes, Gammell's illustrations are more frightening, though no more graphic, than Helquist's. But that is the point! Gammell's work is more effective, it is REAL art, not merely illustration.For the sake of your children's AESTHETIC development, do the right thing!"
2,"After 13 years, I still can't look in the mirror at night: My title should say it all, but I suppose I will talk a little here as well. This set of books is unbelieveable in the sense that Schwartz's storytelling knows exactly how to get to you. I'm a senior in college, and yet I still remember quite vividly reading the stories and being afraid to go near the back of our yard because it backed up to a field. In book two (I believe) the story of the thing in the mirror STILL gives me chills at night (my dorm room has a full-length mirror in it, and I hang my robe over it at night!)And, of course, my father knew just what to do to make me really remember the stories...like sneaking up behind me when I was feeding our rabbits at night at the back of the yard (next to the field, of course)I would highly recommend this collection of stories to anyone who is young at heart, or just wants to scare the pants off of their child (or sibling). The memories are well worth the cost of the books!"
2,"You Think the books are Creepy? Listen to the cassettes!: I remember reading these as a kid and then buying all of them a few years later. The stories were great the illustrations were creepy, and like a lot of reviews, my little brother was scared of that picture in the haunted house story. well, ok it was pretty darn ugly. This is one of those books that still gives me the chills especially fro mthose pictures? oh what a warped mind that artist had but what creative drawings they are!Now, if you think the books are scary, try listening to the cassettes. i am in my twenties and the voice of the narrator and that creepy music gives me the willies. try listening to it in a room by yourself, and see how long it takes you to run for the door! The Scary Stories and More Scary Stories cassetes (i am not kidding) it is a kid's tape and that music will creep you out. listen to it! pick up the book follow along and see how long you last!"
1,"LOVE the stories, HATE that the publisher destroyed the artwork: As a child, I was terrified by these stories and the accompanying illustrations. I was quite upset, upon buying this for my son, to find that the publisher had commissioned new artwork. I'm sure they thought it would make it accessible to a younger audience, and if you're an overprotective helicopter parent who doesn't want your kid to be scared, maybe they're right...but then why buy the book in the first place?I have nothing against Mr. Helquist - he's a very talented artist. But, his illustrations are far too tame for this book. I see no reason to have separated the stories from the original illustrations, and I'm spent the extra money to buy a gently used copy of the original book. It's equivalent to The Velveteen Rabbit or Peter Rabbit with new illustrations...an abomination, and NOT of the good, scary kind!"
1,"Buy the original.: I remember reading these books as a first grader. First Grade! I loved them at the age of 7, and I love them now at 26. Yes, there were some sleepless nights, but that didn't stop me from picking up the book the next day! As others have said, what really stays with you is the art. To have taken the beautifully terrifying artwork and watered it down because some parents don't want to deal with their child having nightmares is a crime against children's literature. One star for this edition. The original gets five.I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I've read that the new artwork is for the thirty year anniversary of these books. Happy Thirtieth Birthday to Schwartz and Gammell's masterpiece. For your present, you get your teeth removed."
1,"Replacing Gammell's art is a mistake!: This series influenced me as an artist in profound ways, and it was all because of Stephen Gammell's illustrations. I remember staying up late at night and just absolutely loving the how terrified it made me feel. It's very sad to me that children today aren't going to be able to experience the same thing because Gammell's illustrations have been stripped out and replaced by inferior, less emotionally impactful illustrations.I'm just happy that I went out of my way as an adult to buy multiple compies of Gammell's version before they were pulled from shelves.TO THE PUBLISHERS: Please make Gammell's version available to the public, so parents can make the choice about which version to buy their children. After over 3 decades, it would be so sad to see Gammell's version just disappear..."
1,"Disaster: The new illustrations are a complete disaster. The stories in Scary Stories To Tell In the Dark are fine. What made the book great were the illustrations. These new ones are a disaster and everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves."
1,"Gammell Made this Series Great: With respect to Alvin Schwartz, there's nothing terribly inspired about the writing, but it is a children's book and I adored it when I was young. What made these books incredible, was Stephen Gammell's artwork, of which I'm still a huge fan. I was very young when I was given these books for the first time and I would poor over the images, staring at each one. And yes, they scared me. But that was the fun! They didn't traumatize me, they just scared me in a delightful way. Releasing a new edition of this work without Gammell's art is like slapping two plain pieces of bread together and calling it a sandwich."
1,"Artistically censored, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS EDITION!: While walking through Barnes and Noble after Christmas, I was wondering how to spend my gift card. By chance, I decided to travel down memory lane and pick up the boxed set of my favorite scary story collections as a child. Horrified (in a bad way), I looked at the shell of the books I once loved as an elementary school child. The original pictures made this collection so unique! For whatever spineless reason, the publisher decided to replace the original ghastly pictures with tame and watered-down versions. Sure, the stories are the same...but the artwork just doesn't fit. It is blasphemy to mess with such perfection. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS VERSION BY PURCHASING IT! Instead, hunt down the originals and buy them. You will be glad you did!"
2,"Great for story telling: While I do admit that these stories are no longer capable of scaring me, I also understand the fact that...this is a children's book. That being said, if you are not 12 and under, you might find some of the stories rather bland-- especially if you're a serious horror fan.Anyway, this book is great for campfire/sleepover/Halloween party-type settings. They're pretty short, but still quite enjoyable. My father read these books to my siblings and I as children during the month of October, and they scared the crap out of us.The illustrations....weird, scary, freaky stuff. Bottom line. In my opinion, the pictures are even scarier than the actual stories. I'm 26 now, and some of them still creep me out to this very day. So, if you're intending to read these stories aloud, then make sure that you show the pictures to add to the scare factor.Overall, I still enjoy this collection of stories. I highly suggest giving them a shot."
2,"This is an amazing collection of folklore!!!: This book came out a long time ago. I read it when it first came out and it introduced me into the world of ghosts and and lore. I was 12 years old then in 1982 and even now when I pick it up to read....it still takes me back to the feeling...when I first picked it up and sent shivers down my spine...in a fun way of course. The stories and the drawings were perfect together. A great book. I have all 3 volumes now and I hope he comes out with a 4th one soon.Thanks Alvin and Stephen for scaring the pants off of me when I was 12."
1,"Not what I remembered as a kid...: This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile"
1,"Good for younger readers: [Written by my daughter] At thirteen and a half years old, I read some of these stories laughing at the end because they were so pathetic. I fail to see the gore in here. There are no descriptions at all, and the plots are uncreative. If I were younger perhaps I would enjoy it more. So if you are looking to get this for someone under fourth grade, by all means, they will enjoy it. But for those who prefer real, set up and descriptive horror, get a Steven Kind book or something. Of course, this is coming from a girl who is read stories about women who kill their husbands with lamb chops and then feed it to the detectives, but, you know, that doesn't make the book any scarier."
1,"Disappointed: I was disappointed with this book. I expected ""real"" ghost stories with substance. The book only has short folklore legends."
2,"The BEST SCI-FI / Adventure book I have ever read. Great!: Simply put, this book is what other writer strive to achieve. It has a little of everything: Fantasy, Adventure, Exploration, Mythology, Romance, and Scientific Theory of the day. Fascinating exploration of what is really in the unused 90% of the mind."
2,"History of Fantasy: Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom."
1,"Average Lost Civilization Fantasy: Dwellers in the Mirage (1932) by Abraham Grace Merritt - 222 pages - rating: 5.5/10The writing style is good and all the elements of a great story are present. If the author had simply written about two comrades descending into adventures in a hidden valley it would have been quite a fine tale. Unfortunately the plot was confused by having the main character not really know who he was half the time eventually leading him to abandon his friend completely.The reader endures a frustrating sense of unfocused direction, forever waiting for the plot to fit back together in a way that feels right. Perhaps the author felt that a simple adventure needed a twist of some sort. Well it did feel twisted, but not in a good way.Claus Kellermann2006 April 15Sci_Fi_Researcher@yahoo.com"

The complete course (text and audio) is available at Audio Forum and Multilingual Books.See you at the Song and Dance Celebration in July 2009!"
1,"Racism and Sex: This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this."
1,"A disappointment: Is this an exercise video? It moves too slowly with too many breaks to give a decent workout to the intermediate bellydancer.Is this a dance instruction video? It assumes you already know a good bit about bellydance, and leaves the beginner to improvise too much.The only part I found helpful, as the previous regular user of several other bellydance videos, was the veil and finger cymbal portion. I'm thinking of buying some finger cymbals now!"
1,"Bellydance Magical Motion: I am a first-timer and it can be rather intimidating to admit for an older woman in her mid-forties! I wanted a video that was decent, and this one surely is. Atea's moves were clear and it helped me to get a good start, but I quickly became bored with it because it lacked FLOW, and I was disappointed that the moves that she so clearly shows do not connect together to form a dance routine. This is what I am looking for. For a beginner to be expected to make a dance out of a bunch of new moves is unrealistic, and I will continue to look for a video that will offer this. If I am to dance like this in front of my husband, (which is mainly why I am learning) I would not be able to show him a routine by learning this video because I am a beginner and don't know how to put the moves together yet. The whole idea is BellyDANCE, and not just Belly EXERCISE, and with the CONFIDENCE I need to dance this way!"
1,"disappointing: I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own."
1,"very simple interpretation of bellydance: I take group bellydance classes and have been to seminars and workshops. This is bellydance but only the very simplest form. Atea is ok and this is a good tape to start with if you are not sure how serious you are about learning. It introduces you to things like veil and zills but it does not instruct you on them. If you are sure you want to dance you should shop around spend just a little more money getting a tape from someone/troup that dances a style you are interested in and has a well known face and name. For example Fat Chance Bellydance for American Tribal style or Aisha Ali for African dance or someone well known for Egyptian or Turkish Caberet. If this is a serious investment for you-get a good tape, beginner or otherwise if you search around you will find several."
2,"Perfect introductory video: This is a great video for learning basic belly dance technique.I am a professional dancer, and I recommend this video to women who are interested in learning how to belly dance.Atea has a very gentle demeanor, so the tape is not too intimidating for a beginner; she covers the basics well however, so that students who choose to continue with real-life classes have a good foundation to build upon.Atea covers finger cymbal (zil) patterns, slow (taqsim) movements, isolations and shimmies.There is a whole section (5 min. or so) at the end where women dance in different costumes, so that you can see how the moves can be put together."
2,"Very helpful: I have been taking Belly Dance lessons for several years. I found this tape very helpful and the instructions clear. I think the intent of the tape is to introduce certain movements and let the viewer be creative. So if you are looking for a full workout you will not get it from the tape. You have to make your own. But that is one of the beauties of the tape. If you want to dance in the privacy of your home or if you are thinking of taking lessons, I think this would be great for you. It is a very gentle tape. Do not be fooled by the 1996 date listed here. That must be the reprint date, my tape said 1985 which explains the dated hair and makeup. Atea is not the most animated speaker but I think that is in line with gentle nature of the tape. I think the tape is very much in the spirit of belly dancing as it encourages the viewer to use her own style."
2,"Belly Dancer from L.A.: Great video for intro to belly dancing and for reinforcing what you already know. I love this video, I also bought their Belly Dance Fast Moves, and Slow Moves, great, great, great, training videos. Also highly reccommend ""The Ancient Art of Oriental Belly Dance"""
1,"beginners only, maybe: Beginners who would like a quick view into some dance might take advantage of this video. There is an attempt to cover a lot of ground, but none of it is done well. Altea is too angular, stilted and her dancing is not that interesting. I would strongly recommend looking elsewhere for quality dance instruction videos. I will say that this is the first video that I've seen that touches on rhythm and zill work. The variety in costume is interesting, but is not worth the price. I recently acquired several of the Neena and Veena series of dance tapes. These are excellent beginner tapes, they are fun and interesting and they show a great little dance at the end as a reward for your work-out. This series would be a better choice for beginners."
1,"These videos are horrible!: I'm sorry, but these are horrible for teaching belly dance. Atea is very stiff & stilted & her chorus dancers CANNOT dance! It is absolutely Scary!I have never seen anyone (in person or in a video) dance the way that they do in this video. If you are interested in learning to dance, please, choose another instructor!"
1,"It's a shame there are not 0 stars on ratings: Reasons not to buy this video:1. She reads from cue cards the entire time.2. She's extremely stiff and boring.I have only watched this video once in the two years that I have owned it."
1,"Scary: I have always wanted to bellydance and got this as my first video. It was not at all what I had imagined and quite frankly scared me. Bellydancers were always something mysterious and beautiful and graceful. Atea is awkward to watch and comes off quite bizarre. Not anything to want to imitate and strive to be like."
1,"There are far better tapes out there...: If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."
1,"Frail White Women Wriggle About: While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos."
1,"should have known better: For basic instruction this tape is OK. Her oral description of the techniques is clear. Atea is not relaxed at all in her instructions or moves. In the instruction part of the video she seems like a puppet controlled by strings. She is too skinny, unattractive and doesn't even have an attractive navel. She fails to hold your attention. Her other dancers are a bit better, but the whole tape seems so contrived and does not move with a natural flair. For verbal instruction, OK, for visual efects you can get much better. And the dance at the end is a real joke. Your money is better spent on Suhaila!"
1,"Not My Favorite: I found this tape very disappointing, it was fun to watch once, but the amount of information provided was very small and too choppy. There are many belly dance instructional videos available which are more interesting, better taught and more informative about how to dance and which provide you with a workout as well. My recommendation is to keep looking."
2,"Excellent introduction, not workout video...: I really got into belly dance workouts about 6 years ago and purchased this video at that time. I remember hating it and thinking that it was the most worthless video I'd seen. After falling off the belly dance wagon, I now lead a group of women who are learning to belly dance using instructional videos. In going through my collection I revisted this video and realised that it would have made a great introduction to the world of belly dance. I plan on teaching a new group next year and will use this video the first night for those who are interested in the history and basic moves. I am so glad that I gave this video another chance."
2,"Great Introduction - A classic: This was one of the first Bellydance instructional videos on the market and I believe Atea did not have the in front of the camera experience and production assistance of many of the slicker more current videos/DVDs.Despite Atea's slightly stiff appearance and the somewhat dated aspects of this production, the essential information (and many of the bellydance fashions) are classic and have not changed very much at all. It is a great introduction to the dance, basic moves, history, and costuming."
1,"Unreliable: Since I have ordered for this product and inspite of the company debiting the total amount for the product from my account, I have not recieved the product till date. The company promises to deliver the product in 12 hrs but its approx more than 3 weeks since the amount was debited but till now, the product hasnt reached me. The company doesnt respond to email queries and its toll free number (the only other point of contact mentioned from their end other than email address) always sounds busy and goes to voicemail."
1,"a trip to unreadable: This attempt at discussing documentary film is fraught with difficulties for the reader. The prose is clumsy, circumstantial and muddled to the point that I found myself reading passages aloud to others for help. Unfortunately none was forthcoming.There is little excuse to buy this book when there are so many good ones such as those by Barnouw and Jacobs which area clear and informative."
1,"Bill Nichols should not be allowed to write: Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."
1,"The original recording probably sounded good, but the mastering on this CD is poor...: Whoever mastered this CD had no idea what they were doing (this makes me wonder what other CDs on this label are like). They use about one-quarter of the dynamic range available with 16-bit audio. Five bucks is pretty cheap for the disc, but you get what you pay for in this case. I'd probably opt for the other Eddie Fisher CD that has multiple albums (one of them being a Christmas CD) on it."
1,"the other reviewer is right: Unfortunately, there is a major problem with the sound on this album and it's so bad that it makes this album unacceptable and a waste of your money. What a shame! Although I can clearly tell there was nothing wrong with Eddie Fisher's performance of this set of songs; the sound quality (and probably the mastering) of these tracks is every bit as poor as the other reviewer states that it is.Therefore, I would recommend one of two alternatives. Diehard Eddie Fisher fans will probably want both! First, there is the very good (even though it's currently out of print) CD entitled ""Songs for Christmas"" by Eddie Fisher which has two bonus tracks by Frankie Laine. Second, there is the CD that contains the music from three of Eddie's record albums entitled ""Eddie Fisher Sings;"" ""I'm in the Mood for Love"" and ""Christmas with Eddie Fisher."" In short, you'll be much better off with one or even both of these two other albums."

1,"The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh: I'm not exactly going out on a limb to say this is going to be the same transfer used almost five years ago by NoShame films. The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh is a pretty good giallo, I'd give the film itself 3 stars. If you didn't buy the out of print NoShame disc this may be a good option.It will be interesting to see if this is indeed the same transfer from NoShame and if it will include the great extras from that disc. Also, if it isn't a new transfer and doesn't have the extras, it will be funny that the NoShame disc from five years ago was list priced at $19.95 while this is listed as $24.95!Time will tell but beware of this shady company, who charges more and gives you less."

I have shopped extensively for waterproof boots for trekking through the rain, snow and slush of New York City. I walk 20-30 blocks a day in these and they perform very well. I have been unable to find a similar pair of boots at this price anywhere I have shopped. I recommend these highly."
2,"great 4 hiking: The ""Fours"" recently purchased are just as comfortable and supportive,right of the box-as were my two previous ""Fours"". My first pair just wore out after four years of constant hiking. Unfortunately, the second pair, after two years of Catskill hiking lost its waterproofing ability but I believe that was so because of a seam opening between the uppers and sole; it has however remained my fair-weather hiking boot. My newest""Fours"" are terrific. I had to get them in second choice,black. I'll get used to them."
2,"Awesome hiking boot: These are my 1st pair of Hi-Tec boots and I could recommend them to anyone looking for a quality product at a great price."
1,"Not Good Anymore!: I have owned these boots for years. They are very good Quality and very Comfortable. They lasted me winter after winter. In fact I had to replace the Laces 3 times. Now for the pair I ordered, not good as Hi-Tec has changed their manufacturer. The pair I own and love are made in China and fit like a glove. Assuming they were the same, I purchased a pair from Amazon (which is priced excellent) but they did not fit proper at all. The Boot is now made in Malaysia or something... and are no longer the same. Which is too bad. So as far as Amazon goes... ""flawless as usual"" Returning them was not a problem. Just beware of these boots. Try them on at your local Store to check the comfort before you buy online.Mark from Thunder Bay ON, CANADA :)"
2,"Excellent for the Price: My ex bought these for me for $70 to get me into hiking here in the Cascades around Seattle (I have always hiked wearing regular shoes, but on flatter terrain in Northern California). I have always worn them with hiking socks and liners and they have been phenomenal. I think the longest hike I've done is 8 or 9 miles in a day, but I've done quite a bit of vertical including Mailbox and Snoqualmie Mountain and these have never let me down. After two years I can still slosh through creeks and melting snow and I've never gotten wet feet. The boots have held up well and look as though they'll last another year or two of hiking and snowshoeing."
2,"buyer of boot: This is my second pair of this Hi Tec boot. The first pair lasted a very long time and was very comfortable the whole time. They break in right away. For years I was a die hard Danner buyer and I can say these beat my last pair of over priced Danner hikers hands down. (really they were more sneaker than hiker -I still love my Danner steel toes for a work boot) But my favorite thing about these Hi Tec boots are the eyes and hooks -THEY ARE THE BEST I'VE EVER OWNED. The laces last forever because the eyes and hooks are so smooth and rounded. Like I said, just bought my second pair -five star goodness."
2,"Great product: Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value."
2,"Good Deal On Amazon: I have bought about 20 pair of these boots over the past 6 or 7 years. I usually buy them 2 pair at a time and wear one for work and one for good.Even when you buy them at the buy one get one half price in stores the price on here is by far cheaper than anywhere else.They are comfortable, waterproof, last a long time and are light weight."
2,"Seems like a nice pair of boots.: I have only wore these boots a couple of times, so I may be reviewing them too soon. As other reviewers have stated they don't seem to need a break in period, but there is a certain ""learning"" period. I say this as a person who literally has worn nothing but tennis shoes for years. The learning is getting used to the extra weight and bulk on your feet. I bought these to be a part of my ""bug out"" plan. I will soon be going on a real hike on rougher terrain to see how they feel then. Plus until I have put many more mile on them to see how they hold up I can't say for sure how many stars they deserve. I give them 4 for now and assuming 200-300 miles from now they are still in good shape I would change it to 5."
2,"Hi-Tec, the best !: Hi-Tecs are the BEST, the coloring has come out of these, now kinda of a weird green color (?), but they have a good tight fit, did a week in them @ Isle Royale last summer ! No complaints."
2,"Men's High Tec Boot: This boot is comfortable and gives me the ankle support I've needed for any type of hiking. I look forward to many years of use from these boots."
2,"Good Boots: Comfotable fit on the loose side. I use a heavier sock and works just fine. Recommended and would buy again."
2,"Only shoe my husband will wear: Kudos to the Hi-Tec designers & manufacturers! My husband wears these daily for all types of situations. Easy to keep clean and looking nice. VERY durable. Almost no time to ""break them in"". Design has stayed constant. Run true to size. No need to change something that already works great. Will continue buying these in the future."
2,"Very good for the price: This boot fits to size and is comfortable. I would purchase again. I use to purchase boots from LL Bean."
2,"Wonderful: Comfortable right out of the box. Well made. Durable. Can't vouch for the waterproofing of them, as I have learned many moons ago.....no shoes are waterproof. I refuse to test them, once you do...they never seem to be the same."
2,"Outstanding boot at a great price: This is the first time I have purchased hiking boots online. I hike a lot. 40+ miles per week generally. I wear out hiking boots in about four months, and am getting tired of driving all over the place trying to find something that fits, and isn't too expensive. These are great! Comfortable right out of the box. Sturdy but still flexible enough to move with your foot. I have only just started with them - but at this price, and with the Amazon Prive fast and free shipping: I will be coming back here for more when I wear the treads off of these in a couple hundred miles."
1,"Overhyped?: Product reviews are very subjective. Based on the reviews of this boot I hoped for a great boot at a fair price. Instead I found the boot to be subpar in terms of comfort. They shoes were stiff and far too 'roomy'. My feet where floating inside them. I returned them immediately. I've had far more comfortable boots right out of the box."
1,"Great boot, Sturdy, Comfortable, But those darn laces!!: They keep coming untied! If it wasn't for that I would give it 5 stars. The boot is waterproof, it is comfortable, wont give you calluses or corns. But they have hooks for wrapping the laces over at the top that no matter how you try and tie it, they will inevitably become undone! The first time: ""umm? maybe I should tie them tighter"", The second time: ""just a little tighter, Ugh it's cutting my circulation"", The third time: ""Ok this is ridiculous, let me try tying em different"", the unfteenth time: ""you m$#%^ stupid $%^ Boot from hell $%^&..."" lol I threw the boots into a lake and hiked in my sandals the rest of the way... Never again will I buy boots with hooks for tying...thanks for reading"
1,"Poor quality control: I am writing this review after I confirmed that my first pair of these boots are bad with manufacturing defect. After reading all these excellent reviews about the Altitude IV, I purchased a pair with high expectations. However, my first pair had a defect in the left shoe. It lacked arch support and it was uneven on the bottom which made my foot hurt. At first, I thought it was just the insole which I put in another pair on top of what is in the boots. However, it did not help, and my foot continued to hurt. Today, I went to a retail store and tried out another pair of the same model and size, and the arch support is great in both feet with proper insole cushion. I promptly exchanged my boots.All in all, my point is that I am disappointed with Hi-Tec for making bad shoes and still allowed them to be sold. 5 star for these boots but 1 star for the poor quality control."
2,"Good enough: I had to return the first pair, each side felt completely different in how they fit.The second pair fit well and are pretty comfortable, I imagine they will be better after break in. They seem well made. I gave four stars because I believe the insoles could be a little better.I bought the black, but after a hike on a dusty trail I realized brown would have made more sense. Oh well.As usual, Amazon was outstanding with it's service. Both orders were received in one day even with two day prime shipping. The return of the first pair couldn't have been easier."
1,"These boots are much darker than the picture: Length:: 0:05 MinsI researched all types of hiking boots on the web, and these are the best. Good durability, comfort etc. I finally ordered the boots and waited. Finally the boots arrived, and yes they were very comfortable and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately the Dark Chocolate color is so dark that it is almost black. I am sure this will grow on me, but the picture on the web site is inaccurate and gave a false expectation. The picture is just a little darker than the CHOCOLATE color, but the reality is different. Actually the color is nice and it will hide the dirt, just not what I expected."
1,"Cheaply made boot: Had these boots for a while. First thing i noticed the laces started to fall apart.I've never seen a boot sole so sparsely treaded a bit like a tyre on your car less rubber on the road less traction and its going to wear out quicker.Because of the sole when your walking the boot seems to fold on top of your toes very annoying. The inner sole has no arch support and not much spring my feet started to ache after 20 mins walking and lay haven't done that before, had to change them.Seems to run a size to big thats not much of a problem just wore thicker socks.Fine to wear in the middle of winter but in the summer just to hot to wear, even when i put on thinest socks i could fine.They don't seem to breath at all.No tag or loop on the back to help pull them on even my running shoes have them.Buy timberland at least lay are real leather and better soles same price!"
1,"Not comfortable: These boots are water proof as advertized but they are not comfortable. I had to get some inserts just to wear them for a day. The lace hooks do not grab the shoe lace and hold so it is a pain just to lace them up. I would not recommend these to anyone."
2,"good boots: i usally buy these boots from famous footwear and pay like 80 to 90 bucks so i found them on amazon alot cheaper, thanks"
2,"Great boot for the price: Just got back from a 9 mile hike in the Smoky Mountains. These boots did great. Very comfortable and held up well on the terrain. Highly recommended."
2,"good shoes: was given a pair of these shoes used,worked in them in my shop welding/ machining/auto & truck repair for about 6 years. very comfortable & rugged. this is why i went online @ located another pair through amazon. so far this pair is exceeding my expectations. my thanks to AMAZON & HI-TEC: heavyhaull"
2,"Happy Feet: These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!"
2,"as good as advertised: Yes, these boots are comfortable. They soften after a few miles of walking. They keep your feet warm and dry, especially with my smartwool socks. Order your normal shoe size, they will be just right with medium weight socks. I won't wear these around the house, running shoes are more comfortable. These will be for hiking, their intended purpose, which they do well. These were the best value that I could find anywhere."
2,"quality hiking boots in good price!: I found this boot very light and comfortable plus the fact that it's waterproof. it fits perfect in my size, it's warm and breathable too. I liked the colour very much and I was very pleased to find the product in such a good price, compared with other hiking boots that they are not waterproof at all. So far I haven't had the chance to try my boot in a heavy terrain like mud or snow but I believe that they are made for such surfaces."
2,"Warm & Comfy: These boots are some of the most comfortable that I've ever worn. Even after being on my feet for more than 6 hours my feet felt good. The boots are very warm which is kind of a draw back since I live in Las Vegas. However, after a day of work I was pleasantly surprised to find my socks were still dry. These would probably be best suited for cold climate hiking, but they work pretty good in the desert. Well worth the money."
2,"Great boot. Light but rugged.: This boot is well constructed for a light weight boot. I experienced minimum break in time with no hot spots. Good support and quite comfortable. I have not hiked in wet conditions so I cannot speak to the water proof feature. The boot runs true to size. I would buy another pair if these were damaged or lost."
2,"BEST SHOES EVER: I WORK IN A MEAT DEPARTMENT,AND MY FEET WERE ALWAYS COLD AND WET.I ORDERED THESE BOOTS AND I PLAN ON GETTING A FEW MORE PAIRS.THEY KEEP MY FEET WARM WHILE BEING VERY COMFORTABLE AND DRY..TOOK A WHILE TO GET THEM BUT THEY ARE WORTH IT"
1,"Right Boot Defective: The right boot sole was defective, had like a ridge on the outer edge making boot very uncomfortable to walk in. Return and refund procedure was painless. This was the second pair of these boots that had defective sole."
2,"Great boots for the price: I bought these boots because my $40 Wal*Mart boots were not getting the job done. These provide excellent support and are very comfortable. I bought them 1/2 size large and they fit perfectly. Don't get these boots if you are going to be working in the cold a lot; they breathe well and are great for cool to hot weather, but it does not take long for your feet to get cold on a day that never gets out of the 30s."
2,"Great purchase: Purchased these boots on Amazon two weeks ago. They were delivered in about 3 days and the fit was perfect. I have found them to be lightweight and very comfortable. And most important to me, since we get lots of snow, the boots keep my feet warm and dry. These boots delivered!"
2,"A really good pair of shoes: These are really good shoes. Great look. Good comfort. No break-in. Very sturdily built. Good price. True to size. The only thing is that, for me, these may not be for general wear. They don't breathe at all (since they are waterproof) and can get a little sweaty and uncomfortable if you are indoors for a while. Driving with these shoes has been a little difficult because there is less leeway for the ankle to move, or rather, it takes some getting used to. I am thinking I should have really bought the ""Low WP"" version."
2,"Hi-tec Hiking Boots: Like them. Very lite and comfortable. Dry. I'm a now-and-then day-hiker and had only worn them once in the woods. There was a problem of soreness under the top, inside gromets on both boots. Got a suggestion of re-stringing the top gromets from my daughter-in-law, and it worked when I wore them all day running around locally. Suggest including some alternative stringing techniques in shoe boxes."
2,"What a great boot!: This is the second pair of Altitude IV boots for me and I can't imagine a better hiking boot for my purposes. I hike hilly, wooded areas daily and wear these boots throughout the year. My previous pair lasted three years and the only problem is the lining of the heel wore out. They are now my work boots.They look good and lace up well. Break in is immediate. I don't walk in rivers, but waterproofing lasted a year before needing treatment. Their lightweight and durability amaze me. The only thing that concerns me is that Hi-Tec might stop making them by the time I need another pair."
2,"Great Boots!: Bought these boots to replace a pair of New Balance boots at twice the price that didn't hold up. These boots are easily more comfortable and are better built. Even though my current pair are still in great shape, I'm tempted to buy another pair in case they become discontinued."
2,"Hi Tec Altitude 4 mens boot: Comfortable boots that are indeed water proof and actually do breathe. They seem to work well for the winter wearing anything from cotton socks to solar socks depending on the outside temperatures. It should be noted that they do not have a slip resistance sole so they can be slippery on smooth wet surfaces. I haven't had a chance to use them in warmer weather to see fully how well they breathe. For the price they are a very good buy."
2,"Yes, they are waterproof!: My work takes me out in bad weather frequently, and I really need a boot that will keep my feet dry. I have suffered through 3 different pairs of ""waterproof"" boots that gave me no protection--you get what you pay for, I guess. Someone suggested I order from L. L. Bean, and I was getting ready to fork up the dough, when I saw these in an e-mail from Amazon. They are not fancy, but they ARE waterproof! And, after an initial breaking-in period, they are quite comfortable. I am thoroughly satisfied with these boots."
2,"Good backpacking boot - for a while: I tried on several more expensive backpacking boots before settling on this one. I have high arches and this boot fit and felt the best. I've put 70-80 miles of backpacking on the boot, including some hard, heavy miles. So far the boot is holding up fine. And they feel great - like I'm walking on cushions.The only downside so far is the leather has worn more quickly than I expected and the waterproofing seems to be wearing off - even after an additional waterproofing treatment.Update:My left boot stopped being supportive after about 90 miles of mid-weight backpacking (with 30-40 lbs). These boots are probably just not durable enough to rely on for backpacking."
2,"Hi-Tech: This is an excellent light-medium weight boot. I wanted to find a reasonably priced hiking boot for weekend trips. This boot meets all of my expectations. It is light but sturdy, waterproof but still ""breathes"" and it fits according to the size listed. This is not a heavy boot for large pack trips but should be more than enough for light trips.The seller delivered as promised and gave link for tracking. I would defintiely buy from this seller again."
2,"Great hiking boots: Pros:- Light weight. I am used to military grade boots and this feels like I am walking bare feet. And it doesn't look it in the pictures- Arrests the ankles and keeps them for twisting- Comfortable soul. 5hr hike over rough terrain easily- Does not oven roast my feetCons:- I would have loved to see some stitching going around the shoe. I know glue has come a long way, but I still don't trust a glue only shoe. So I brought mine in to have it stitched. Sorry Hi-Tec I won't be buying another one in the next 3 yrs."
2,"Very happy: So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good."
2,"Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Hiking Boot: Delivery time was excellent. The comments others have made about the boot running narrow are correct. I ordered a wide but while the boot fits ok it does feel tight in the width. The first couple of times I wore it on short hikes it was comfortable, but on a 3 hour hike it rubbed off the skin on the side of my left heel. Also, the boots have a very stiff sole. However, walking in wet snow the boot remained perfectly dry. I'm new to hiking so perhaps this is normal, but the boot leaves something to be desired as far as foot comfort goes."
2,"reboot: Great boots. Never had better. Hold up well and definitely keep the water out. Nice and warm in the New England winters. Highly recommend these boots."
2,"Hi-Tec Boots Altitude IV: This is my 2nd pair. This pair was stiff and needed some break in, but feel great now.Would recommend"
2,"Excellent boot: This is the boot I've been buying for general purpose for 10 years. An excellent boot - wide enough for my wide feet - fit well right out of the box - leather is tough enough to last many years and out sole is very close to being a 'mountain' out sole. Good support, good shank, good cushion. this my boot of choice of work and light hiking."
2,"Excellent Mid-range Boot!: I just now purchased on Amazon my third pair of Hi-Tec Men's Altitude IV Boots (over the course of 10 years). I live in Minnesota and have found these boots to be excellent in all types of weather, year-around. In addition to wearing these boots every workday on my warehouse job, I do a lot of weekend hiking, camping and exploring of the North Woods and have never been disappointed with these boot's performance. When worn (and sized) for a good pair of extra cushioned wool socks (I buy Smartwool Trekkers Series), these boots are warm enough for shoveling snow and are also comfortable and cool enough for summer wear. It is a perfect light, all around utility boot and I highly recommend them. They are the only boots I have ever literally worn out (they never failed due to workmanship or materials). I just replace the shoestrings with a good quality boot lace and they ""keep on running""!!"
2,"Excelentes botas.. excelentes boots: Excelente producto, quedo muy satisfecho con el producto y con Amazon, por la puntualidad en la entrega,la calidad del producto, zapatos muy comodos, resistentes. Excelente muy recomendable."
2,"Big Improvement After 30 Years!: I only buy boots every thirty years. These are lighter and better feeling than the heavy clod-hoppers they replaced. My only complaint so far (I've only worn them once to date) is that the bow-part of the laces tends to slip behind the tongue of the boot, coming to rest on my socks."
2,"14 YEARS OF LOVING THIS STYLE: My husband loves the look, fit, comfort, and durability of these boots. He has been wearing the Hi-Tec Altitude IV in Dark Brown for at least 14 years. He enjoys working outside and gives these boots a run for their money. The waterproofing works great. A pair of these last him at least a year. The dark brown doesn't show the wear and the boots generally still look ok when he throws them away, but he actually wears out the padding in the soles. I order these boots at least three pairs at a time, because I'm scared they will stop making them. I want this boot that he loves to remain popular and not be discontinued."
2,"Hi-Tec Boots Work for Me: Had an older pair that lasted for about 6 years. I loved them and sought to replace them with the same model. I got them and they broke in pretty quick. I am happy!"
2,"Great Boot: These Hi-Tec Boots are excellent and very good quality.I use them while I am a rural carrier. they are a great work boot.I recomend to all. Peter."
1,"not good: 3 months with them and my left boot it open in half i think the glue they use is not good i mean 70 bucks for 3 months is not worth it"
1,"Cheap Boots: Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots."
1,"VERY NARROW: This pair of boots are too tight and between sizes is big jump,i don't know if there is any other way I can stretch them a bit,they are also only made for soft soil , asphalt concrete will finish them too fast"
2,"hiking boot: We bought these for my husband. He has a rough time with shoes of any kind. These needed some time to be broke in but beyond that are very good. Good price - good value for the money, we think."
1,"Horrible: Don't know what all the people who gave these boots a great review were thinking but these are not great boots. They did arrive on time but they are not worth the saved money. First off the boots had spots around the lower edge(where the boot and the rubber bottom meet) where there were huge holes where there was missing glue. Tried them on anyway and took them off within 2 minutes off walking around my house. They were the most uncomfortable boots I have ever tired on. They were so bad my feet and ankles hurt for an hour afterwards. The ""insole"" they put in the shoe is a joke at best. It feels like you are walking on a piece of granite. Would not recommend for anyone looking for any boot that they want to actually wear."
1,"Not As durable as i hoped: Lasted about as long as a pair of boots from wally world for half the price. I live a on a small farm and I do some welding and construction. I guess for a city slicker they will last a life time."
2,"Good: This product arrived on time and in excellent condition. These boots have a good arch and seem sturdy. They do look a little cheaper than I anticipated. The tread is great. Size runs true."
2,"Boots: I have an old pair and they are great in the winter and comfortable. SoooooI ordered a second pair for this winter and by the looks at the snow fall yesterday, it was a good choice."
2,"Hi-Tec are the best shoes: This is my second pair. First pair I wore until the soles were paper thin. Still use them about the yard. Second pair was deliverd quick. Fantastic waterproof feature and comfortable. I occasionally spray shoes to keep them in top notch condition. I high recommend these boots. They are perfect also for hikes as I have wore mine on the AT everytime I visit."
2,"hi-tec mens altitude IV: great boots even works great while walking up wet boards!!! buy this product you will not be sorry, well made and true to size."
1,"Heavy and Stiff: I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction."
1,"not up to her standards: not nearly as good as her usual work if your hoping to hear her forget it it is a pale comparison with authors who don't have her style"
1,"Is this a junk book?: In the name of science, you will try to prove with propagande;if you really want to decode how junk scientifics manipulate the world: go http://nomorefakenews.com and do not buy this junk BOOK!"
1,"I'm great, everyone else stinks: I am sympathetic to the perspective of this author, but not to his arrogance or all of his smug conclusions. He is too much the demagogue for my taste, liking as much to degrade as to disagree with his adversaries. This is well beneath the normal standards of his sponsor, The Cato Institute, which usually holds to an exceptionally high standard.I much prefer the similar but far more intelligent and respectful works of Warren Brookes and Julian Simon. They were so good they didn't require ""attitude."" In contrast this author is frequently on TV, the perfect medium for the condescending sneer which is his mien. This book doesn't belong on the shelf with Henry Mencken, who wickedly and hilariously debunked quacks. Pass on this and buy ""The Vintage Mencken"" to read his evisceration of chiropractic."
1,"Junk Book :)): If you are a big fan of industry PR campaigns, then this book is for you!However, if you are a critical thinker that is interested in evidence and facts, this book is Junk.Interesting note: The author is affiliated with organizations that are funded by major industries such as 3M, Chevron, Dow Chemical, etc. He is most likely writing what they are paying him to write (e.g. their point of view)."
1,"Don't fall for the ""junk science"" scam: Steve Milloy, author of this book, is a Washington, DC, lobbyist who has represented just about every polluting industry imaginable, especially the tobacco industry. If you doubt this, read the book Trust Us, We're Experts! by Rampton and Stauber, who have pages on Milloy, CATO, American Council on Science and Health, and their PR campaigns to smear health and environmental concerns as 'junk science' waged by evil public interest groups and activists like Ralph Nader. Pure industry propaganda."
1,"Shameful: The author is funded by the big industries which explains the selection of certain topics and the huge bias it reflects. No matter how many good reviews and bibliographic citations appear here, the ideas expressed reflect corporate interests and not scientific knowledge. Always look at the source!! Research very well where this people's funds come from and that will tell you a little bit more about the real issues."
1,"Shows fans are starving for Kate Bush recognition: I am a big fan of Kate Bush. I have collected all of her music, including her cameo appearances on other groups; yet I cannot agree with the other reviewers regarding this CD.The only good thing about this album is that most of the artists did indeed attempt to render original, different versions of Kate Bush's wonderful songs. However, I find their talent a little limited.Listening to this album made me a little sad, as it made me wish that a real tribute album to Kate Bush were released, with versions by artists such as Peter Gabriel, The Cure, Depeche Mode, Morrissey, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, Tori Amos, etc...The fact that this album was highly rated by other reviewers shows how desperate fans are for more recognition of the talent, uniqueness, and influential nature of Kate Bush's music (especially on some rather popular female artists that followed her)."
2,"What a lovely treat!: Quite frankly, I'm suprised that no one has ever done a Kate Bush tribute album. Given her cult following and ecclectic catalogue, and the number of recording artist who cite Kate as a major influence, it's an project that's more than a little overdue. And Tom Dunning rises gloriously to the occasion. Clearly everyone involved in this album considers this a labor of love, and it makes for a delightful listen.Some of my favorite tracks? ""There Goes a Tenner"" is rendered in trippy-hippy-hoppy-happy fashion - clever and fun. ""Hounds of Love"" is just lovely to listen to, perhaps even better than la Kate's version. Those who chose to cover the B-sides have my devotion, as those are among my own personal favorites. And the tracks I didn't love, well, I didn't love 'em to begin with.Simply put, if you're a fan of Kate, you owe it to yourself to add this to your collection - and if you're trying to introduce any of your friends to la Kate, this album could only aid you in your cause."
2,"BEAUTIFUL: THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FILMS I EVER SAW. VISUALY STUNNING. IF YOUR A FAN OF GREAT CINEMATOGRAPHY DO NOT MISS OUT!!!!!!!!! THIS FILM WON THE OSCAR IN THAT CATEGORY FOR BEST CINEMATOGRAPHY IN 1970."
2,"Where Is The DVD?: How can such a beautifully filmed movie directed by David Lean not yet be available on DVD? The superior quality of DVD over video tape would lift this film to the level of how it played on the big screen when first released. The storms, the Irish coast and just about every other scene filmed would look so much better on DVD. John Mills gave his finest performance in this movie and won a deserved Oscar.It would be a fitting epitaph to his memory if the film distributors reissued Ryans Daughter in DVD. Nearly all of David Leans other films are available in DVD format. Why not this epic film?"
2,"When oh when!: Each month I scan the ""new"" issues to see if the studio has issued this first rate movie onto DVD but to no avail! when one sees the amount of rubbishy films now being re-issued, it really makes me angry, I guess the reason being the fact that Ryans Daughter was panned in the States, but hay Yanks, how about we Brits? the film was well received over here and is still regulary screened on TV. Freddy Jone's photography should be reason enough but add Sarah Miles, Bob Mitchum, John Mills, where is the problem?"
2,"FOR THE SERIOUS COLLECTOR: Beginning with ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" in 1957, the only David Lean film I would rate less than 5 stars is ""A Passage to India"" and I would give it 4.8. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is simply one of those films that any serious creator of a DVD library should have on his/her top 25 list. It is so spectacular that, for the life of me, I can't imagine what has taken so long for it to arrive in DVD format. As with all his films, Lean's cinematography is truly unequalled, but there isn't a single ingredient with which one can find reasonable fault. ""Ryan's Daughter"" is what filmmaking should always be and so rarely is."
2,"best of david lean: Ryan's Daughter one of the best cinematographic delights of the 20th century. An outstanding international cast provides truly the most marvellous of characters and depth of storyline. A truly emotional rollercoaster for the viewer with seductive influences. Great."
2,"Beautiful Epic: I saw this movie when originally released in 1970.It had always left a strong impression upon me.Seeing it 42yrs later,is a real treat.It had created a profound impression upon me in '70 but years later it had softened a bit.The depth and beauty of Ireland is quite evident.Robert Mitchum,is stellar in this role.The story is timeless."
2,"Stunning cinematography; gripping story: A very, very long movie that will hold your attention with some of the greatest cinematography, ever, and a well-told story of passion, intrigue, and haunting evocation of what is truth? One of the ten best movies of all time. Extraordinary!"
2,"ROMANCE SET IN NORTHERN IRELAND: Ryan's Daughter (Two-Disc Special Edition)David Lean's very interesting romance set in Northern Ireland in 1916. Robert Mitchum is almost type-cast as the sleepy-eyed and plodding village school - master, who marries young Sarah Miles. Christopher Jones is the British Officer who has an affair with Sarah during his stay in the village. But there are only two real stars of the show - the beautiful, sweeping scenery and John Mills, who won a supporting actor Academy Award, for his brilliant, sympathetic portrayal as the hunch - backed village idiot. Production designer, Stephen Grimes, obviously inspired by David Lean's extravagance, creates an entire village to use as the main set. Trevor Howard and Australian, Leo McKern are also very good in their roles."
1,"ryan's daughter: The DVD was fine - it would be useful if you explained about the regions and how you have to change your dvd program to watch the dvd."
2,"Good: I originally saw this movie on TV back in the late 1970s. I like the cinematography and of course the acting is superb. However I think the beginning and intermission could have cut out where all you get is about 10-15 minutes of orchestra music with a still picture of Ireland's countryside. Especially at the end of disc 1 where the music goes non-stop and then you realized that the movie continues on disc 2."
2,"Compelling and haunting: This should have been a classic. I saw it originally in the 70s and decided recently to rent it...I wanted to know if it had the same appeal.....if anything, it was far more beautiful than memory served. the scenery is spectacular, the acting suberb! They don't make movies like this anymore! Pour yourself a nice glass of wine and settle down to a very entertaining movie."
1,"Lean Pickin's: Beautifully photographed but over-produced historical women's picture on an epic scale. Yes, it has its fans but so do those dime-a-dozen bodice-ripper romance novels on supermarket racks. Still, gorgeous cinematography and a lusher-than-lush musical score can't disguise the fact that this David Lean misfire is an overblown snooze of elephantine proportions. A pallid Sarah Miles manages to suggest what Julie Christie might have done with this part, horribly miscast Robert Mitchum plays a flower-pressing milquetoast and a dazed-looking Christopher Jones is so bad his voice had to be dubbed. However, John Mills received richly-deserved Oscar for his portrayal of village idiot struck dumb by plot inanities he witnesses in mute silence. No wonder he's speechless."
1,"Irish movie: The lead actress does a poor job of acting.Was recently in Ireland and stopped at the location of this film."
1,"customers beware: When I purchased this product, I thought I was getting a good deal because of the cheaper price. However, once I received it, I knew I had made a mistake. I've been using this product for several years now, and I knew just by looking at this one that it wasn't right. The texture was incredibly thin, and the color was much lighter -- something that could only leave me to believe that maybe water had been added to it.Lesson learned -- spend the extra money -- you're paying for quality!"
1,"Worst quality I've seen in a long time: Pretty cheap for a Hi8 camcorder, but quality is unacceptably poor. The zoom lever is hard to operate, and when you put in a tape the mechanism makes tons of noise, really making you nervous. LCD screen is a little flaky, deciding to quit working occasionally so you have to turn the machine off, wait 10 seconds and turn it back on. It also destroyed a new TDK Hi8 tape this past winter. I think I wasted my money, and look forward to getting a Sony this summer when I get a new job."
1,"Samsung 8mm video camera: The on/off switch is stuck. I cannot therefore record or review tapes. I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired."
2,"Great Budget Camcorder: I wanted to record all the new things my 7 month old son is doing. I'm also broke. I need a good camcorder without spending a fortune. I looked into eBay and even used camcorders. When I read all the good reviews about this product, I thought I'll give it a shot.With the first use, our family fell in love with it. For the price, you can't beat this deal. The picture quality is a whole lot better than what I expected. This is my 4th Samsung purchase and everyone so far has been a very positive experience. I wish this camcorder has some ""advanced features"" like USB connectivity so that I can download movie clips to a computer. But then again, I didn't have the extra [money] to spend. In couple years, I plan to buy a digital camcorder but for now this will suffice.Bottom line:For 1st time buyers, this is a good start. It's not the best camcorder but definately a good one. It's worth the money."
2,"Good for begginers: I was looking for a good camcorder for beginers. This one is perfect. It is not the best camcorder, but a very good one. I gave it 5 stars because the price is cheaper than it should be.It is worth much more than it is."
1,"Not worth it!: This camera semed ok at first... but less than a month after I bought it, the eyepiece viewfinder broke and only displayed a white screen. In bright light (like outside) the entire screen is unfocused and a light object being filmed ends up looking like you filmed the sun, it does not filter the light very well. The battery lasts for about and hour and fifteen minutes when the viewfinder is open; this is not so great when you are out and about and cannot re-charge.This camcorder is the lower class model for Samsung, overall I thought it to be cheap and a waste of money. For only a few dollars more you could get a reliable Sony.The camera did have a few pros though, the mirror, negative, mosaic and art effects on the DSE button were fun, but not worth the hassle the camera gives overall. My advice: DON'T buy IT!"
1,"Malfunction after short time: The camcorder worked only a couple of times.Then the playback picture was totally ......."
1,"Awkward controls, below-par reliability: Like Korean cars, this Korean camcorder does what it says, but it's not something you'll be proud to own. The controls are awkward... even Sony's compact minidv camcorders have better buttons. The video quality is sub par, and my unit, which I received as a factory-sealed gift, broke after about 6 months, a first for all the Asian electronics I have owned. For a little bit more money, you can buy much better camcorders from Japanese manufacturers."
2,"This is definitely a ""MUST HAVE"" in your collection...: Two things alone on this album from Jason Robert Brown are all you need to be satisfied with the purchase.1) Track #3- ""Someone to Fall Back On"" is one of my all-time favorites of his. It has such a catchy, but soothing, melody line that can't be passed over.2) Lilias White bustin' it out once again on ""Coming Together"" -- adding a glorious rich sound that fans of her will love to play again and again.Few composers/storytellers can tap in to emotion with such satisfying melodies as this gifted musician. Anything he records will gladly be added to my iTunes b/c I can't get enough. Truly wonderful."
2,"You MUST buy everything by Jason Robert Brown!!!: So hello. This is Grant, a performer and music lover. I've followed Jason's music from the big stuff that everyone knows to the little shows like Urban Cowboy in Coconut Grove that not everyone got to see. This CD is a MUST have. Jason's excellence and genius shines through with such variety in this newly released CD. His adaptability is shown best in Parade, and his fantastic ability to write songs for starving singers comes through in The Last Five Years and Songs For A New World, but if you just want a great CD to listen to with fantastic variety and all around genius, this is the CD to get. This would make a great gift for any open music lover. Don't forget to keep up on his new works. He's a busy guy and is often coming out with new original music. Also look out for his new website!"
2,"U need this JRB CD!: This compiliation of songs from gifted, Tony award winning composer Jason Robert Brown is a feast for the ears. For JRB fans, it is a chance to hear his signature style music and witty lyrics up-close and personal, without the constraints of a musical's plot. For newcomers to Mr. Brown's music, you'll get a taste of everything, from the gospel sound of ""Coming Together"" to the big band swing of ""Grow Old With Me"" to the spirited rock/musical sound of ""Getting Out"". My favorite is the ballad ""Someone to Fall Back On"", which he often uses as an encore at his live performances. The energy in the band and vocals captures the feel those live performances . This is a 'must-have' CD!"
2,"Another Aw Inspiring Career Move: Just when you thought JRB couldn't get better he does. The music is greatly appealing to a wide range of listeners. Of course if your a fan you already have it. If you are not familiar there is something for everyone. It isn't the stereotypical musical theatre album. It has a wonderful rock/pop feel with musical theatre sensibility as only JRB can seem to produce.One of my favorites is Over. A tremendous song about a soldier who just died in the desert of some war torn country (just pick one). It is touching, poignant, and somehow even patriotic.So anyway run to get this album because it will be a classic and if you are not into musical theatre it is because you haven't heard it executed like this."
1,"OK: I really like songs for a new world and the last 5 years. was excited to purchase this disc but was kinda disappointed. lacks the edgy variation and creativity of the others. not bad and the cover track is fun--just not up to the success of the other jason robert brown work."
2,"excellent resource: I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed."
2,"BRIO Curved Track: BRIO is the most durable and has the best quality wooden train on the market. Another must have for train extending. We have about 10 sets of these. It makes it really easy for our son to build whatever he wants. Another great product."
2,"really good release of the ORIGINAL 1957 LP!: I think too many people are assuming that they are buying a compilation CD when they pick up this release. In fact, this was the original album released in 1957. Ella gets top billing becuse she was the biggest of the three ""names"" at the time. These sessions were laid down between Jan 4, 1956 and April 30, 1957. Each artist gets a chance to showcase their talents and it is apparent that, when they all get together for the few numbers that they all share, they are really swinging and having a great time. Basie's band was in top form, the arrangements were wonderful and the vocals are spot on. This is a terrific window into the past."
2,"Great Fidelity 1956 1957 Swing From Basie and Williams.: What we have here is the crack ""April In Paris"" era Basie band with one Ella F track singing with Joe Williams on ""Too Close To Comfort"", a bunch of tracks with Joe taking the lead and a few great swinging instrumentals and a few alternative sides.The whole album works well, great sound,exciting music,especially if you like the croon of Joe Williams.The famous ""Joe Williams sings CD"" with Basie is considered the better,no arguing that fact, but this CD is a nice addition to your library.Great blowing on the 3 versions of One'O'clock Jump here make it all worthwhile."
1,"Good print quality - bad mechanism: I bought this printer new, when it was HPs top of the line. I have been very disappointed in it from day one.The print quality is fine. The duplexer is a joke. It needs the bottom of the page to grip the paper, so it can not print on that area. The driver software gives you two options to deal with this - print everything at about 90% scale to squeeze the content into the printable space, or re-sort the pages allowing the SW to move the page breaks. Neither is appealing, so I found that I reverted to manual duplex mode - taking the paper out and reversing itself myself.The biggest problem I have with the printer is frequent paper jams. Even when using HP brand multipurpose paper, I find that the printer jams about 25% of the time. In the quest for speed, the paper load mechanism is just too fast, pulling in many sheets of paper instead of just one."
1,"Lousy: This has to be the most horrible printer in the world. If I could give it -5 stars I would. I just got a new digital camera and of course just got this printer. Now when I print my photos it has blurred lines through it and is all messed up. Its print quality is horrible. It may be a bad printer - but HP is no help at all. They keep saying to install new drivers, when it is clearly a hardware problem. I want to throw this thing away, unfortunatly I got it on clearance and I'm stuck with it. Don't buy this pile of junk."
2,"Older Craftsman Garage Door Opener.: I have an older Craftsman Garage Door Opener. Had replaced the gears to my garage door opener and it would not work right. Would only move a foot or so and stop. Looked up information about what could possibly be wrong and it suggested that the RPM Sensor Assembly probably needed replaced. Replaced it and it now works like a charm. Was much cheaper then buying a whole new automatic garage door opener."
2,"Got 'er fixed: This was one of the most simple and cost saving things I have done. instructions were exact and took longer to put cover back on vs. change the part."
1,"Product Performance: RPM sensor was defective. The lift motor would not stop running with the new circuit board installed.I removed the new circuit board and replaced it with the old one and everything seems to be OK now.The part is so inexpensive it's not worth returning."
2,"Worked like a charm: My garage door was not working for 4 months.And did some research and bought this product.Right away the garage door started working great."
2,"RPM Sensor Assembly: Great purchase. I was so frustrated and I couldn't figure out what was causing my garage door to reverse direction after just a few feet. This was an easy fix. Everything was packed well and shipped fast"
2,"Customer service: The item is excellent and that was exspected and it resolved the issue. But the seller is very customer focused. Thanks"
2,"Best Computer Acessory: A year and a half ago, I purchased everything I needed for my first computer. I did a lot of research and went way wrong with highly recommended Dell computer. But, based on what I could see at the store (the clerks at CompUSA are not too eager to help) I bought this printer. It has been the best purchase of my computing experience. Photos are flawless, as is everything else I print with this printer. It seeems to do what it is supposed to and musch more incredibly well."
2,"Fantastic Photo Printer: This has been a great printer for me. I regularly print both 4x6 and letter size photos. The quality is outstanding, and the automatic paper sensor is a good feature. I had absolutely no problems with set up. The only improvement would be to print borderless."
1,"Envelope Feeder Never Worked: I have a small business and it was important that the envelope feeder work well. From day 1, this has been a nightmare. Components of the printer block the envelopes/labels and they don't feed properly. If you use internet postage, you lose money with the misfed labels/envelopes. I'm very disappointed and am shopping for a new printer now, only a short time after purchasing this one."
1,"My mistake: This printer has been a nightmare. First I can not usemy Visioneer scanner. They say it is not compatable.I removed a jammed paper, and since then anything I print,such as invoices, checks and such, come out with blotchedprinting and paper tears. I get NO help from technicalsupport(They're learning). No 800 number, which means youhave to call CA on your buck.I used to swear by HP. Now I am convinced that theirproducts are close to junk. My opinion is STAY AWAY!"
1,"Poor customer support: The printer worked fine for about a year (no borderless prints though). After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print. I expected a ... repair bill (replace the roller) since the printer is out of warranty. According to HP, no 1215 printer can be repaired. Their only option is an exchange. They will send you a new HP 1215 for [price] (retail is [price]) and you return your old one. Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option. Buyer beware."
1,"Recipe for grief: Until this product, I was a huge promoter of HP printers, but the HP 1215 apparently was designed with little attention to Apple compatibility. Unpredictably it refused to print first in 0S9 and then in 0SX. I'm frankly sick of downloading and reloading new drivers only to find they don't work and/or freeze up my entire computer. Because of this printer I've cleaned off my entire hard drive, lost valuable files and programs, and still wound up with a non-functional machine. It's been in my closet for 6 months, and I'm considerably happier with a new bottom-of-the-line Canon printer."
1,"Hate This Printer! Annoying messages to reset it !!!: I had had two HP printers. Both broke in the same places - where the paper shoots out from the printer; the wings or the ""arms"" which guide the paper from the printer - both broke easily.Also I get an annoying message on my computer that the ""yellow box marked !"" is on and therefore I have to exit out of the printer mode and reset the yellow box so that the ! is deleted. Then go back into the printer mode. This is so annoying that I am never getting an HP Printer again.If you look on the instruction book, the annoying message can never to resolved - only by resetting the message yellow ! again, and again!!!!!!!!"
1,"Hp Customer Care! A Joke!: On 04/03/02 I bought a new printer hp photosmart 1215, it installed perfectly, now, suddenly it decided to stop dead!I have contacted Hp Customer Care re the problem....timeout settings...no help availadle...also my PC tells me there are now no drivers for this device installed! How can this be???"
2,"Worth the wait: This album is worth the wait. Great vocals accompanied by rocking fuzzed out riffs. Sounds like the perfect cross between Unida and Kyuss. The cd hasn't left my player yet. The only problem I have (which means 4 stars instead of 5) is that its fairly short. It really only has 7 tracks that total under 30 minutes. That aside, any fan of this genre of music will love it. The cd flat out rocks all the way through."
1,"Unfortunately Cannot Do ZERO stars: This is not a book. It is nothing more than the postings from an AOL message board that is actually from way back in 1994. What a joke. I don't know who wrote up the ""publisher's review"", but talk about a mislead. Each page is like a separate posting from this ongoing thread and is for the most part very boring. The so called author is simply one of the posters who got involved in the postings at some point. That's it. The so called author tries to constantly instigate controversy, especially with one other poster. Probably for the purpose of creating the controvery of being able to get this book published. Though how he found someone to publish it is beyond me."
1,"Can't Believe This Was Even Published: Talk about junk. Who would publish somethng like this? I see that it was published by some unheard of publishing company in Lakewood, Ohio? What other garbage have they published? I can find nothing about any other books published by this ""so-called"" publisher. Only some kind of religeous tracts tye stuff. The earlier reviewers have lready hit on the faults of this book. While the book indicates that permission was obtained from AOL to use these postings, how abot all of the individual posters? How many of them simply used a username that was the same as their e-mail address header? And how many of them were embarrassed when friends or family may have stumbled across this and recognized them and their postings. Postings that were assumed to have a certain degree of semi-privacy? Shame on AOL and shame on this so-called author for simply copying months and months of postings and copying them into a manuscript and then somehow getting it published as a ""book""."
2,"This player deserves more US air time: I fell in love with Brasilian jazz my first trip to Rio. I've been there many times and was always amazed, visiting the little clubs, listening to a lot of great players. I don't remember how I found this guy, but, understanding music 'from the heart', Leo understands, and plays it that way. In my view, he is one of the most sensitive sax players I've ever heard - check out #3 on Black Pearls, you'll see what I mean..... I think it would be a great project for Leo to hook up with Bob James and Fourplay, and let Leo play, I mean feature him, write and produce songs that bring out his talent, give him lots of freedom. I rated this 4 stars, simply because of a couple of songs I skip pver, but all in all, it's great listening. And as a bassplayer, I've spent hours playing along with him."
1,"The ultimate ""touchy-feely"" book.: This book contains such advise as writing down personal affirmations which you will repeat to yourself at the beginning of each day:I am calm, prepared, and entertaining.I am fit and beautiful.I am humble, patient, and compassionate.I am enough, just the way I am.If this kind of advise is your cup of tea, then this is your kind of book."
1,"I was better off with Alexandra Stoddard....: Very much like Alexandra Stoddard's books, too much alike. Stoddard's books are less wordy and still get to the point. I stopped reading this book when the similarities became clear, been there done that. If you are looking for something in the ""guidance"" area, try Stoddard. She has many better books. I have some and re-read them often for refreshers and finding the ""gems"" I forgot about."
1,"too small to read: My rating of one *is not a reflection of the story or the gorgeous illustrations; but, on the unreadable digital version. Shame on the people who will profit from selling something with an unchageable font size that is too small to read. It was obviously scanned in and formatted on landscape view with two hard cover book pages per one narrow digital page. The font and the page size can't be enlarged. I'm really disappointed with Amazon for not only selling something of such inferior quality and even more disappointed with them for highlighting this product as a daily deal. :-("
2,"A classic favorite.: Paul Galdone captures the story just right with his wording and illustrations. This is a must-have for my grandchildren. You can't go wrong with a Paul Galdone illustrated folktale."
2,"A short story....: A wonderful story but somewhat short. Take out the illustrations and the total story would be two or three pages long. But I love some of the old tales and I love cats, so this was a must for my library. The Puss In Boots reminds me of the tricksters of Native American tales. Enjoy!"
2,"A well earned Caldecott: Puss in boots is always an enjoyable tale, probably because it is so based on wit.I really enjoyed these illustrations they are glowing and friendly, making one feel very comfortable as they turn the pages. Puss is adorable, the expressions that our fine illustrator manages to convey through his feline features are just fantastic! Time and time again I was always dissapointed when I found a page that the lovely cat was not on.A wonderful additition to any collection of books for children or lover of fairy tales."
1,"Not what I expected: I purchased this for my granddaughter, we love reading together. The print was WAY to small and no way to make it bigger."
2,"Very good price and quality.: This fiber optic (cable) is paired with StarTech.com 10/100 Fiber to Ethernet Media Converter Multi Mode SC 2 km (MCM110SC2)StarTech.com 10/100 Fiber to Ethernet Media Converter Multi Mode SC 2 km (MCM110SC2)and has no loss of signal, once the bends in the run are expanded."
1,"Boring: Gorecki, as usual, is striving for profound angst, but for the most part this Quartet just comes across as boring. The second and fifth movements are terrible. The first movement develops some tense themes that Gorecki could have explored further, but he drops them midway to revert back to his usual droning. The third and fourth movements are the only ones with character, with the latter developing a decent amount of bittersweet sadness."
2,"Deceptively good: Just to be clear: the album is uniformly quiet and just consists of electric guitar without lots of special effects except long sustain. The genius of the record is that MazzaCane can bring out so much with minute details -- muffled string noises, minute pitch changes, perfect arhythmic timing of notes. Don't mistake apparent simplicity for emptiness, as another reviewer did. One of the most moving records I've heard, with a rare, sad, clear quality. I'd recommend this as a first album by this artist (he calls it his best too)."
1,"There's nothing in the Airs: The samples sounded interesting, but a few spins revealed that there's really nothing of substance here. While I'll concede Connors sounds like a proficient guitarist, he's just not really playing anything here. The Airs pass by like a breeze, leaving nothing memorable behind. It is not substantial enough to be either good or bad."
2,"A well written and thought out book on Risk Management: This book provides practical and insightful look at risk management and how it can benefit companies. Reading and understanding this book should be a pre-requisite for any person going to take on management position."
2,"A Must Read for Risk Management: This book is not only about the theory of enterprise risk management, but also a summary of the author��s experience in practicing risk management for more than twenty years. And what is more, there are several case studies that are deeply analyzed in the book. It is because of this that I think it is an excellent work on enterprise risk management. In addition, it is interesting that the Balance of the Yin and Yang in the Chinese traditional philosophy is applied as Lesson 7 by the author. It is a must read for all business managers and students who want to pursue a career in risk management."
2,"Fables from India Well Presented.: Pancatantra the ancient book of fables, is an interesting collection of animal stories composed in India around the third century of the Christian era. It has been one of the first Indian classics to be translated into the western languages. Therefore these fables with their relevance to political, moral and religious life have become widely known and acclaimed. Patrick Olivelle the chair of the department of Asian Studies at the University of Texas in Austin, equipped with necessary expertise and familiarity with the subject matter and language, has translated these fables and rendered them in plain everyday language, though with all their complexities, for the sake of the American readers. The very informative introduction and extensive explanatory notes make the text fairly simple and easy to understand and relish. For those interested in the Indian classics, this storybook is a wonderful gift."
2,"Good translation.: This is an eminently readable translation though I still prefer Arthur W. Ryder's translation. I believe Ryder's translation is currently out of print."
2,"Great Update of, and Supplement to, Strunk & White: Similar in style and tone (and usefulness) to Strunk & White's classic ""Elements of Style"". Short, pithy, intelligent. Lots of examples, followed by Professor Lasch's thoughtful, penetrating, often witty comments. Recommended for all undergrads."
2,"Characteristics of Bad Writing: Plain Style was written in 1985 by Christopher Lasch, a history professor who was frustrated with his students' lack of writing ability. There are six sections:Elementary Principles of Literary ConstructionConventions Governing Punctuation, Capitalization, Typography, and FootnotesCharacteristics of Bad WritingWords Often MisusedWords Often MispronouncedProofreaders' MarksApparently Lasch's frustration with students went beyond just their writing skills. ""I keep simplifying my course in 20th century American history, but the students keep getting dumber faster than I can simplify it,"" Lasch wrote in a letter to his father. ""Every year the illiteracy gets worse.""The current book was published after the author's death and includes an introduction by Stewart Weaver. The introduction is disproportionately long, taking up 42 of 121 pages."
1,"I appreciate what he attempted, but...: I appreciate what the author was attempting to do, but do not feel the book succeeds. It is too dry to read on its own (as a sort of William Safire-style curmudgeon rant on language), and not comprehensive enough to be a useful desk reference.In addition, the first 30 or so pages are actually a biography of the author (who died a few years ago) by one of his colleagues. Perhaps to someone researching Lasch himself (who was, admittedly, a renown academic) this material would be interesting, but it isn't in the context of language reference."
1,"Unable to install: My title says it all.I am running Windows XP with all service packs. AMD Athlon 64X2,4 GB Ram 2 hard drives, tons of free space."
2,"Decent book for its time.: This book was written in 1923, and I have an original copy I bought online from some book site.It is worth the read, and it has some history to it. (Names, old addresses, etc.) but because of it being in the early 20th century, the information might be outdated.A good classical read on the subject none of the less."
2,"A great dance groove.: I haven't as of yet come across another album with such a wonderfully mellow techno-jazz beat. One of the best music purchases I've ever blindly bought. Especially good for those listeners who enjoy a hauntingly beautiful women's voice laced throughout their beats. Cannot reccomend this album strongly enough!!"
2,"Summer classic: It's been a good year for Liverpool's The Coral. A mere number of months after their stunning debut comes this, surely one of the singles of the year. ""Pass It On"" is their state of the universe address, a plaintive plea for understanding. It begins a little like The Beatles' ""You Like Me Too Much"" but soon becomes its own thing of beauty. Far more low-key than anything on The Coral, they seem to have dispensed that elemental quirkiness which so defined their earlier work. Frontman James Skelly is the real star of this track, his magnificent vocals squarely front and center. Anticipating their forthcoming Magic & Medicine album, ""Pass It On"" is a summer track for the ages and The Coral have done it again. Was there ever any doubt?"
2,"hard to find - but worth it: A progammable thermostat that you can actually set differently for each of the seven days - perfect for people with non traditional schedules. And the 'off the wall' setting capability makes it very convenient to set up."
2,"Get rid of cycling: I was sick of the constant cycling my cheap programmable thermostat was doing. It would cycle my furnace and A/C every 5 to 10 minutes regardless if it needed it. This one let's you adjust that cycle temperature. I adjusted it so now it can have up to +/-2.5 degree F swing. So if you set 65 it will kick on at 63 and shut off at 67. It can be adjusted so it stays at a constant temperature as well, but I was trying to get rid of the constant cycling during cold weather. Great product so far."
1,"All 3 with unusable LCD screens at night: We have 3 of these Lux systems in our sprawling house. All 3 have in a few short years had the LCD screens become unusable at night with the incorporated light. The programming part works well enough, The LCD is ok in a well-lit area, but we need to use a flashlight every time we want to adjust them. Not surprisingly, we adjust them less often. It is very frustrating and seriously compromises and otherwise good product."
2,"Excellent book to guide women through the divorce process: This is a thoughtfully-written book by two experts that answers all the questions divorcing women should be asking themselves, from whether to hire a lawyer or mediator to how to manage money and a household after the divorce. Written by women for women, it describes what to expect at every stage of divorce and includes very specific information on how and where to get additional help and support. I would definitely give this book to a friend who was contemplating or going through a divorce."
1,"Irrelevant for some state & women: I found this book almost entirely irrelevant and in sore need of update. Nowadays, many states have ""no fault"" divorce (e.g., Colorado), the men's movement has changed culture, and MANY women are career women who are the main bread-winners of the family. This book takes NONE of that effectively into account. Therefore, the book was a total waste of money and time for me. I do not recommend it for any career woman and dedicated mother who is the bread-winner and in a position to need to pay maintenance, lose significant assets, AND lose parenting time despite being BOTH primary parent and primary breadwinner. This book needs to catch up with the times."
2,"What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce and Custody:: This book was a god send. It helped me with so many issues. I found it to be a true survival guide with advice that works. I purchased the book months ago when I was first separated. Now my ordeal is almost over but I still keep the book by my nightstand and refer to it constantly."
1,"only about custody!: This book should be titled 'What Every Woman Should Know about Custody Battles'. I found absolutely nothing helpful about a basic childless divorce in this book. If you are going through a divorce and have custody issues, this might be okay for you. If you have no children, don't even bother."
1,"Awful: I bought this book for a friend going through a divorce, luckily I read it first. In a section about a father not being involved with his children they accuse the mother of not making him feel welcome, in a section about court they advise women not to wear short shirts or make-up and it only gets worse. This book was written to convince women to stay married so they don't loss their children."
2,"What Every Woman Should Know About Divorce And Cusody: This is the most thorough and informative book on divorce issues that I have read. As a divorce attorney, I am always curious to know what other attorneys are thinking. Ms. Smith's perspective and commentary mirror much of my own experiences and conclusions. The book is easy to read and filled with relevant, realistic examples and practical advice. I highly recommend this book to both nonlawyers, who have a reason to learn about this subject and to lawyers so they can refine and expand their knowedge of the divorce process."
2,"This book is a real roadmap, precise and thorough: This book is an indispensable tool for any woman who is facing (or contemplating) a divorce with custody issues and who doesn't know how to even begin the process. It's a ""comfort"" book in the sense that it is precise and reassuring--almost a roadmap to follow-- especially when life seems out of control. This manual is a great resource to share with friends."
2,"From a Man's Perspective: I am soon to be beginning the process. I will be initiating it. I read this book to gain insite into a woman's perspective and possible strategies.I guess if you haven't read or learned much, this book can have some tremendous value. If you're somewhat knowledgeable about the process, it is good, but not the end all.One thing to remember, only 1-2% of all divorce cases are tried in court. Yes, judges approve them, but the real work is with the lawyers.It's clearly worth it price."
1,"What a pity: What a pity that a book about a part of India that has received little attention turns out to be so poorly written. A trip that could have been very interesting to read about is instead a tedious catalogue of ""then we went there and then we did this."" The author comes across as a naive young woman who did not even know to take toilet paper to a remote part of India and patently she (and her travelling companions) had done little (if any) reading about the history and politics of Assam. This is, unfortunately, an unchallenging and uninformative book."
1,"Great coverage...lousy quality: The NBC coverage offered in these videos is fascinating to watch as it shows a tragic, unfolding event as it was covered live in 1963. NBC's coverage was in black and white, except for brief segments early on from WBAP-TV in Fort Worth. The only problem with the videos is the actual video quality...which is lousy. THIS VIDEO IS NOT AN OFFICIAL NBC RELEASE. THE MATERIAL DID NOT ORIGINATE DIRECTLY FROM THE NBC NEWS ARCHIVES. IT IS A BOOTLEG. NBC only released one such video of its JFK coverage, a capsulized version back in 1988 which contains almost none of the coverage seen in this collection. This material is of marginal quality at best...and looks like it ewas copied about eight times before being released in this version. If you're not concerned about this, then you will find it very interesting to watch."
1,"Don't waste your time: I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."
1,"Not worth the money!: This c.d. is definitly not what you are expecting. Some of the songs have like 3 different words fpr like five minutes. I definitly don't recomend it."
2,"You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs...: Chumbawamba is an underground British band that has been around for almost 20 years. They had a stroke of surprising luck in 1997 with the infectious dance/sports anthem Tubthumper. However, that song is not a good representation of their sound. Musically they remind somewhat of Scissors Sisters with a little Frankie Goes to Hollywood or maybe a rebellious Abba with a few shots of whiskey in them. Their lyrics are very political in a very abstract way and written for a British audience at that. The CD is also filled with many anarchist spoken-word soundbites. I checked out their very active website and they are selling t-shirts with George Bush's face above the label TERRORIST and the back of the shirt says ""You Can Never Have Enough Anti-War Songs"". Even Tubthumper is about ""shouting to change the world, then having a drink to celebrate""."
2,"From the land of Tellytubbies...: Despite their pretentious, anarchist pose, these guys CAN knock out a blooody goood toon. The title song and the intro to ""Amnesia"" merit special mention but the entire work is strewn with lively and colorful bursts of sound. Give them an ""A"" too for originality and their monster drummer. Less gratifying, but still interesting, are the snippets of dialogue lifted from British television and their mixing of curious psychological and political fantasies. Thumbs down on the silly ""Creepy Crawling"", ""Mary, Mary"" and the obnoxious Jude Abbott."
2,"DA BOMB: Chumbawamba rocks. It rocks because you can listen to it continusualy and you never want to change the track. The best track is the first one. I think it is ""Thumbthumpin."" I am surely going to buy this cd."
2,"A great CD full of terrific tunes and amazing lyrics.: This CD is the best CD I've ever heard! How did it go unoticed? It's full of terrific lyrics and fast-paced, exciting tunes. This is a must for all music lovers!"
1,"Actually 1 stars: This CD sends the wrong message (anarchy), and some of it is just plain bizarre. Trust me, you'll tire of it. Save your money and go buy Barenaked Ladies."
1,"These guys suck: Chumbawumba are the lamest band I've ever heard. The song ""Tubthumping is also so annoying. I heard the whole cd from a friend and he and I both think it sucks. I think these guys are just a bunch of ""one-hit-wonders"". Please save your money and buy something else."
1,"They get knocked down, please stay down again!!!!: Worst band ever, period. The final sign that the music industry cares not for talent. Basically like the fabricated Spice Girls only they could at least carry a tune. These guys can't even play a radio, just horrible. One catchy song that was ridiculous in the first place and even at that there was proof because it was only in regular radio play for about 5 weeks. Loserville has a soundtrack and it is sang by chump a whumpa!!"
1,"r u all kidding? this album sucks horribly...: yet even some of you who agree that the album bites still say that ""tub thumping"" is okay, even if it ""gets old after awhile"". that song is CRAP!!! has to be one of the worst songs ever to get play. EVER! sounds like a bad radio commercial for some english beer they're trying to market in the states.that song (if you can call a random string of cheesy choruses a song) makes the strongest argument AGAINST ANARCHY that i've ever heard. proves that people who can't agree on anything can't make a song that makes any sense or follows any consistent theme.gotta go - just threw up in my mouth from the bilious memory of this worthless pop drivel."
1,"don't buy this cd if you don't like chick bands: this CD blows. tubthumbing was cool at first and then it got old real fast. the rest of the songs blow. I am so sick of this CD if anyone wants to buy it from me... wait I'll pay you to take it. I think they need to have a 0 rating instead of 1. don't buy this CD"
2,"An excellent collection.: This CD is a wonderful collection of Chumbawamba's music. It is consistently good, slipping slightly on One by One and majorly on Smalltown. Unlike most CDs this had some great songs at the end such as I Want More and Scapegoat. I highly recommend it."
1,"Disappointing: I thought the Cd would be good after hearing Tubthumping and Amnesia but I was wrong..I feel that other than Tubthumping and Amnesia, there isn't anything about this Cd to boast about..."
2,"happy songs: I love to sing along with this whole cd, which was once in my collection! I had to get the whole album--it has such a wide range of musical styles, all good tunes :)"
1,"In war, this cd is played as torture to make prisoners talk.: This cd is the worst cd I've ever purchased... wait... I didn't even buy it... somebody lent it to me and they didn't want it back... I would NOT reccomend buying this cd to ANYONE... but if you have some money you wanna get rid of, you can buy mine..."
1,"Where's the variety?: It may have some, but not much. Tubthumping gets boring after listening to it about 5 times. Amnesia is the best, but that song is OK."
1,"So-so: I thought ""Tubthumping"" was pretty good,no,really cool,but the rest! UGH! Those songs were a complete BORE. If you are planning on buying this CD, I strongly advise you not to. Buy a single of ""Tubthumping"" instead,or borrow it from a friend,if you don't have any friends,from a CD rental store.My apologies to the people who enjoyed this CD."
1,"Buy some other album from those nice people at amazon: With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre."
1,"Skanky lightning in a bottle: I have heard many CD's in my day, and none have irritated me as much as this CD. They spout of phrases of anarchy and rebellion while doing the talk show circuit promoting this piece of crap. They seem to be the worst kind of hypocrites, ones with a bad sense of humor. Tumpthumping looses it appeal the second your hangover sets in and manages to sit in your head for the rest of the day. It seems destined to become a staple in the yuppie dance floors of the future. After sitting through the full 45 minutes or so of the Chumbawumba exprience, I reversed my stance on euthenasia. Stay away, fa r away. Unless you are completely lacking in taste, then you have my blessing."
2,"If you think Metallica is kiddie-music...: This album is sweet. I originally bought it just to listen to ""Tubthumper"" but by now that has become my least favorite song. One of the postive aspects of the CD is the constantly changing tempo of each song. The many different styles and tempos in each song and the fact that the songs have some meaning make it all the more worthwhile. Buy this CD. You will find yourself headbanging to every song on this album in no time."
1,"not worth it: i thankfully got this cd for christmas, so i did not have to waste my money on it, i liked ""tubthumping"" at the time. i had no idea about what a dissapiontment it would be. it's sounds too kinda ""un-musical"" i have no idea where they got some of those sounds from, but it's nothing that should be used it hte future. i have had this album for a whole year and still havn't listned to the whole thing.so, sample the rest of the somgs on a cd before you put it on your christmas wish-list!!!"
2,"Caught totally by suprise...: When I got this CD (as a gift, I was really into ""Tubthumping""), I was very afraid that much of the rest of the CD would be garbage. I was very wrong. These guys (and gals) are more talented than anyone seems to give them credit for. There's something for everyone on this CD."
1,"In the words of Dr. Evil, ""riiiiiiiiiiiigggggghhhhhht"": I'll be the first one to sadly admit, I bought this album only having heard ""Tubthumping"". That was a huge mistake. If you're considering buying this album only because of that, please DON'T! ""Tubthumping"" gets old after a while anyways. The rest of this CD is hardly worth listening to. There are some mediocre songs here and there, but trust me, this is not worth your [money]."
1,"Very Predictable: Much Like Most Bands Out Today Chumbawamba pretty Much Sounds Like every group out now.The Lead Off Song Got The Ball Rolling but the Album Sounds Like a Decade Late take on Jesus Jones.Nothing worth Seeking out here."
1,"Icky lyrics!: Tubthumber was the reason I wanted this cd and I got it. About 1,000,000 times on the radio plus 100 on the cd. Now I can't stand Tubthumper.The lyrics and music keep repeating themselves. All the other songs have bad lyrics that are negative too! This was not the best choice for me."
1,"STAY AWAY FROM THIS CD!!: This CD is pure crap. The songs are pitiful and shaky. Your money would be better spent on ANYTHING else besides this cd."
1,"AAAARRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!: Minus ""Tubthumping"", listening to this album is equal to putting your head in the frig. and slamming the door! Avoid the hype. Not even good dance music."
1,"Blech!: I used to not be a fan of modern music - this Cd almost turned me off modern music completely (it was a gift from a friend.) There is one good song on it: ""Tubthumping"" (I didn't know that was the name; I thought the name was ""I get Knocked Down."") Anyhow, that is the only good song. The rest are bad (except for ""good ship lifestyle,"" which is okay.) The good part about the Cd is if I turn it on, my sisters step out of my room almost instantly. So, if you're looking for a way to disturb the peace, this is it."
1,"uhm, why was this popular?: Is there anything less than one star? This might be the worst CD I have ever listened to. One of my friends bought it used, shortly after it came out. Note that fact for future reference: if it just came out, and people are already selling it used, it SUCKED. The lyrics are positively nonsensical, and there is nothing creative or interesting in the instrumentation, melodies, etc. There's one song where all they say is ""drip drip drip goes the water."" What the heck is that supposed to mean? More like, drip, drip, drip melts the plastic, since I left this in the trunk of my car."
1,"A Dud: Pssst! The Emperor has no clothes. All but a few seem afraid to admit it. Thank goodness for those brave folks who panned this vaunted 'classic' here. I only wish I had heeded their warning."
1,"Poorly written: This novel has a lot of ideas that do not fit together. The science, characters, and society are not memorable."
2,"He wants more...: I have nothing bad to say about this book. My 14 year old son read it, liked it, and he wants more. I am getting another Asimov book for him today.Read On !"
1,"Well, it's Asimov: This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."
1,"Dry Sci-Fi: I respect Asimov as a writer of science fiction. However after reading all of the Foundation series I wish it had more humanity in it. The book was overly complex. The characters did nothing for me. The Foundation series is over rated in my humble opinion. It falls in the category that I call dry sci-fi. Asimov's Robot series was better than this."
2,"Ahead Of His Time.: The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."
2,"THIS ONE IS GREAT BUT DEPENDS UPON YOUR TASTE: I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it."
2,"A very well writen, exciting book about a possible future of: This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Everyone who likes Prelude to Foundation MUST read this."
2,"Great Book for any Age: I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."
2,"A good lead-in, but the series gets better: (If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed ""Foundation"" and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated ""Foundation"" may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."
2,"Future and Past of the Human Civilization: a Epic Story: Before ""Foundation"" i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."
2,"Excellent unless you are looking for Star Wars: This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment."
2,"Good novel, but the other books in the series are better.: Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."
2,"Get this book: Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more."
2,"Excellent stepping stone to world of SF!: Folks, till foundation happened to me, I had for some inexplicable reasons never got introduced to world of science fiction (SF).(unless you call hitchhikers guide to galaxy as one) Based on influence of the die hard coterie of Asimov's fans, I decided to start my journey with Foundation...........and I have really found it cool stuff............worth reading and excellent investment of time..........since it rejuvenates you with fascinating ideas and terrific narrative. Looking forward to picking up the next one."
2,"Classic: I hadn't read this since I was a teenager. I had forgotten what an excellent writer and fantastic mind Isaac Asimov was. It was refreshing to see character and idea development that kept my interest and actually made me think. Read this and enjoy all Asimov was to the Science Fiction genre."
2,"If you like SF this is the one book you should read: If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"
2,"Science Fiction Masterpiece: Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."
2,"Perhaps the finest sci fi series of all time: In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written."
2,"Best Book by Asimov (fiction): I have read almost all of Asimov's fiction, and this book is by far one of the best. I would recommend it to anyone interested!Boom, Done.-Jeremy Paul Gallagher"
2,"One of the best ever: This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the ""must read"" list for any sci-fi fan."
2,"Just kidding around: This book was hilarious. I read it yesterday, and I am still laughing my Asimov. Get it? Hahahaha. Huh. Okay. Nevermind."
1,"Still hasn`t arrived after two months: The book was apparently resent after not arriving 5 weeks after ordering and it still hasnt arrived after two months. phshopus customer service has been responsive but there is something going wrong with the shipment process"
2,"The Genius of Asimov: I had read the Foundation trilogy when I was a teenager/early 20's. The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade. For someone who hasn't read him before, Foundation is a wonderful introduction. You'll read more."
2,"Foundation and the complete series: Couldn't put any of the books in this series down. There is a college education in those books!"
2,"Unique transposition of our history: It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""..."
2,"Psycohistory: When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating."
2,"A true Science Fiction Master!: As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book. Definitely one of the great science-fiction classics just like ""Stranger in a Strange Land"", ""Childhood's End"", along with modern-day cyberpunk like ""Neuromancer"", ""Count Zero"", ""Prey"", ""Cryptonomicon"", ""Snow Crash"", ""Darkeye: Cyber-Hunter"", etc."
2,"Foundation is a good read for all readers especially scfi fans: Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you."
2,"Amazing Asimov read !!!!!!: I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"
1,"Not my style: The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."
1,"first but not the best: No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated ""encyclopedia galactica"" entries was awkward and rough."
1,"letdown after the first book: I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book. The two stories lacked charters that I cared about and unlike the first foundation book their was very little to contemplate. Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page."
1,"Just not my kind of book - Others liked it.: It isn't my kind of book but, I thought, I would give it a try. We read it in our book club. Some of the readers liked it, most of them didn't. I didn't. But, the author did have great insight to the future in the 1950 - 1960's"
1,"Misleading: The title of this item says ""(3 books boxed set..."" however, when I purchased and received this item, I was only sent one book. I was expecting three books, especially for the price that I paid, and was only sent one. Therefore, I am rating this item very poorly."
1,"I just cant do it.: I read the foundation books and was reminded why I don't like asimov. The man has Phd's in chemistry and a gazillion other physical sciences and he likes to show it off. And that makes it very hard for us lay scifi geeks."
1,"Why is kindle version so expensive???!: Publisher: I will NOT buy a book that has been on the market since the middle of the last century in paperless format for these kind of prices. You've got to get your head back out in the open where you can see.Amazon: Get busy leaning on the publishers to bring their prices down. Why is an ebook as much as a hardback???This has got to stop. I think I'll pitch my kindle in the trash.Disgusted in San Diego"
1,"A very bad book: ...To my surprise and disappointment, I found ""Foundation"" to be an exceptionally terrible ""book"", totally undeserving of the praise it has received here. As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged ""novel"" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature. In fact, the only time I should ever like to mention it again is as an example of poor writing, atrocious story-telling, and science-fiction that is totally wanting for any kind of inspiration. ..."
1,"An Example of What is ""Classically"" Wrong with SciFi.: I only recently read this so called masterpiece. I even went do far as to order the special complete edition from the Science Fiction Book Club. Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads. Blech."
1,"Do not buy this HP 960 printer from ANTonline: This ANTONLINE site has falsely advertized this HP Deskjet 960Cse Color printer on Amazon. After paying the advertized price of $61.97 plus $22.82 shipping and handling charge, they sent and delivered you a 6 oz size bubble wrapped pack Innovera Solid ink sticks/cartridge.No invoice or phone number in the package!"
1,"Good printer, so so on photos, crap for envelopes.: I have just spent 5 minutes trying to get this damn printer to print an envelope without mangling it. Wonderful."
1,"TERRIBLE PRINTER: I've had this printer for a while now, and i rarely can get it to work properly. When it is not taking 2 pieces of paper at a time, it is printing in some strange code. The quality of the picture is alright, but nothing special. I would highly recommend not to buy this printer"
1,"Don't do it!: I've had HP printers for years and have always liked them. However, this printer is a real headache. We've had 3 --taking the time for returns was a hassle. With each of these HP printers, the paper feed mechanism has been defective. With every document I printed, the feeder malfunctioned and the paper was torn or badly misaligned. I found out on the HP website that others have had similar problems with a number of HP printers--malfunctioning paper feeds. HP has done nothing to correct this problem. I've now become a Canon printer owner am quite happy with Canon printers--excellent quality and no problems. I'll never buy another HP printer."
1,"DULLSVILLE: I saw his film when it was originally released. Robert Altman maybe have been one of the world's greatest directors,but COLD DAY was a low in his career.Sandy Dennis was brilliant as always but the ultra slow and moody film seems to go on forever.Seeing it on video years later again did nothing for me.Sometimes you like films better the second time around but not so for me in this case.It was no wonder that the film was largly forgotten shortly after its original release."
2,"The Brainwashing of the American Investor: Brainwashing of the American Investor provided invaluable insight into today's Wall Street. Steve's personal experienceon the Street provides the reader with information that one only 'wonders about', but now it's in black print for all to see!Steve also provides enormous amounts of information regarding his investing 'style'---one that appears too simplistic at first,but is based on steadfast rules and established algorithms.I have definitely benefitted from the book--for personal edification as well as financial growth! Hats off to Stevefor a treasure load of info....definitely a 'small investment'for a much bigger payout down the road!"
2,"A realistic approach to taking profits.: Mr. Selengut presents a realistic approach to investing. He identifies how to achieve continued returns from high quality stocks and bonds. He outlines basic criteria needed to make sound investments and sets realistic targets for profit. A must read for all investors who want to take the profit."
2,"A must read if you want to save your money from the "" SHARKS: Written in a conversational style with plenty of humor, this book gives you the questions and answers you need to keep and increase monies that are being put away for investing and retirement. This book lays out a program for getting the best bang for your bucks, and gives an eye opening education on how the "" Market "" really works. I have purchased three books already and am purchasing five more to give to friends and relatives who want to salvage their portfolios from the ""SHARKS"" on Wall Street."
2,"Excellent!: Some of the reviews I've heard and read here and elsewhere contain criticism of Mr Selengut's journalistic style, grammar, spelling and even the relatively amateur way the book appears to have been typeset. SO WHAT?! If you are prepared to follow his easy-to-follow advice; to pay attention to the detail and to do your own individual stock research, it's worthwhile. I read the book twice and highlighted the most important points the second time around. In three and a half months, I have realized profits of $44,176 and unrealized net gains of $7,509. Not bad for an investment of a little time every day and under [$$$] for the book!"
1,"a few good ideas spun out way too long: There are a few decent things here, for example the author's idea of your stock portfolio as inventory in your personal business, but there is too much pretense at telling the reader Wall Street ""secrets"", and not enough hard analysis. And even the inventory metaphor falls down: Good stock picks should increase in VALUE, not just in price. And if they do increase in value, and the price does not get too far ahead of the value, they should not be too quickly sold."
1,"Don't waste your time: Ridiculously hard to follow the random thoughts of Mr. Selengut. The constant questions and change of font made it even more strange. Reminded me of teachers I had that may have KNOWN the subject but couldn't TEACH it at all."
2,"Right on the Money!: I heard a short segment on Stu Epperson's radio show as he discussed investments with Steven Selengut. I heard enough to prompt me to search for his book on the internet. As a securities rep. myself, Steve appears to be ""right on the money"". I didn't want to put the book down until I was through. Steve's trading strategy is refreshing information that should make a lot of people a lot of money with less risk. I have even contacted him with a couple of questions and was pleased with his prompt and courteous response. Thank you Steve for sharing your success with everyone. In your next book, please remember that all ""advisors"" are not ""sharks"", some of us do put our clients first."
2,"Investing Made Successful: I heard Steven Selengut on a talk-radio program and was intrigued by the premise of the book. My intrigue led me to purchase the book, which was an eye-opening experience. After reading it, I'm convinced I had been sucked in by my former financial advisors to purchase products which I didn't need and cost too much. Instead of jumping in with both feet and totally revamping my investment habits, I've followed Steve's advice and gone into it slowly. I'm migrating from mutual funds (and annuities) to individual, high quality equities. My next step is to start purchasing bonds, as soon as the rates recover. Although the information provided isn't anything new, it was a slap in the face to make me stop my destructive investing habits."
2,"Still swings after all these years: For an album recorded nearly 1/2 a century ago (December 1956), Swinging Kicks doesn't sound outdated. The sound quality, while not up to today's digital perfection, is still quite listenable. The playing is awesome (lotsa power!), but what do you expect from guys like Maynard, Bud Shank, Ben Webster, etc. According to the liner notes, the tunes come from a film Buddy scored called The Wild Party (unfamiliar to me). Interestingly, some charts have 2 pianos (Andre Previn and Paul Smith). Originally produced by Norman Granz, 40 minutes. By the way, Buddy has a web site up with some interesting remembrances of his Songbook recordings with Ella - check it out."
2,"West Coast - Forever C-O-O-L!: OK, so this album (whoops - gave my age away there...sorry, CD) is dated. So what? Some things are forever relevant and enjoyable, whether dated or not. I bought this album back in the 50's, lost it somewhere along the line, and have just discovered it's out on CD. My advice to any jazz fan is to BUY IT! There's not a better example of original West Coast Cool out there. The arrangements are interesting and varied... the section and solo work fabulous. My only (tiny) objection is that I wish there were a few jazz Standards included. But that aside, it's still a wonderful addition to anyone's collection and a MUST HAVE if you're into WCJ. By the way, Buddy has a fairly recent CD out now called ""SWING"". And does it ever! This one is full of old standards re-done in a kickin' modern swing style. Very innovative, although it may not appeal to the more snobbish ""swing"" purist."
1,"Childish and lacking creativity.: This book was an enormous disappointment. Though it states it is a book for all ages, I would like to see my 25-65 year olds on my sales staffs, playing things like ""Rabbit & the Carrot"" or""Magic Carpet Ride."" This was for very young children, at best. Most of these games were not unique, creative, or interesting. A true waste of money."
2,"Energizers and Icebreakers Very Good for 4-H Club: We are using the activities from this book at our 4-H Club meetings. The age range is from 9 - 18 and I have had not problems finding activites that work for everyone."
1,"What are these guys?: Oh man. I don't even know what these guys are. Are they dogs, cats, or 5 dollar bills? I have no idea. I wish we could take a look at this movie 80 years in the future and see what futuristic space people have to say about busting boos with a vacuum cleaner. I mean the symbolism is magnificent, the vacuum cleaner represents the struggles of mankind to end racism while the boos represent Strom Thurman. It's a beautiful masterwork that takes a certain Narron/Dorinsky-esque look at how retarded you are for reading this review."
1,"Some errors in book - disappointed: The book is okay, but there are some errors. Chapter 7, page 123, says that ""Protein synthesis begins with the transcription process"". This becomes a quiz question at the end of Chapter 7, but according to the quiz key in the book, the answer ""transcription"" is incorrect. Also, quiz question number 1 at the end of Chapter 7 also appears to give an incorrect answer (according to the quiz key). Also, there seem to be more inconsistencies. So I am disappointed. Otherwise, if it weren't for these errors, this could be a great book - a five star instead of a two star."
1,"A huge disappointment: This book is nearly worthless. Large parts of it are just lists of organisms and there are frequent grammatical errors, typos, misspellings. It's clear it was written in a rush. The blurb on the back says ""lavishly illustrated"" which is a lie. All the illustrations, of which there are few, are not even B&W photos but line drawings, and not even very good ones at that. For example, The very first two, meant to illustrate two different organisms, are hard to tell apart. Save your money and buy something else."
1,"Could be a great book....: This could be a great book. A lot of wrong answers in the chapter quiz area. This could lead to a lot of confusion in a subject that is confusing enough on its own (that is why we bought the book in the first place...right?)."
2,"Nice Shape: The book was in great shape, very minty! Demystified books really have excellent ways of relaying the message definitely a great study aide"
1,"Microbiology Mystified: What a waste of paper. Nothing useful in here at all. This is more for a third grader than an adult taking a college course. Find a better book or you will be sorrowfully disappointed."
2,"A must read for parents and teachers!: I love this book!! It is an easy read and provides problem-solving approaches and communication techniques that improve the behavior of children, teens, and adults. It further identifies social issues resulting in the breakdowns of our moral intelligence with reminders on how to improve."
2,"Puts into words and ideas moral concepts that can be difficult to explain: I have a sixteen-year-old who is questioning all morals. I was finding it difficult to put into words the importance of morals. I bought this book for her to read. She isn't reading it, but I am and I'm finding it very helpful in facilitating discussions with her. At dinner time I bring up one of the seven moral virtues and ideas that the book presents. I've found that it leads to great conversations with her about character and moral behaviors. It has given me the words for concepts that can be difficult to convey in our current morally challenging times. I recommend buying this book when your children are young and referencing it often."
2,"a great guide for a christian parent, or any parent: Very well written. Practical applications for implementation in your own family. I did not know how i was going to effectively teach our values to our children outside of trying to lead by example. This spelled it out for me. I have seen it work, my children are embracing these values and are developing characters any mother would be proud of. Even when they do wrong, they are usually aware of it and do apologize sincerely."
1,"Stopped Cold: I had seen this authors' works offered for free on the Kindle page and since the price was right downloaded two of them. I was happily reading ""The Lamp In The Desert"" when I got to location 2458-61, and there in the middle of the page was the ""N"" word. Now I realize these books were written in a different time, and people had different morals and people were unenlightened, my problem now is, do I want to read a book written by someone so obviously contemptuous of me, no matter what decade the writer lived and worked in? I think the answer is NO! I was truly enjoying the book up until location 2458-61, and had even gone so far as to call my sister and recommend them to her. I am truly trying to be a bigger person and but I cannot truly support people who do not respect me. I am deleting this book and the ""Rosa Mundi and Other Stories"" today. Life is hard enough and I shouldn't have to fell insulted by something I bring into my home for pleasure. Sorry Ethel, ya gotta go!"
1,"Ignore the heading, it's NOT compatible with HP P1538A: I ordered this part as an upgrade for my HP e-pc c10 which requires specifically HP part P1538A. I thought this Viking part is compatible as it clearly says HP Part# P1538A by Viking on the Amazon heading. The computer couldn't boot up on installation. A phone call to Viking tech support says it won't work on e-pc series despite it being P1538A compatible. so beware!"
1,"Big Disappointment: This book was a major disappointment for me. Bette was a very annoying character. She reminded me to much of Chloe's mother in the first book. Also this book did not seem a little bit cheesy to me. The fact that they decided to make Bette a spy just adds to how cheesy that this book is. The beginning and end of the book were wonderful, but the middle was very disappointing."
2,"Great for Begginers: This book is perfect for begginers. It shows you a skill and then has you try it yourself with the .max files that come with it. It has you learn by experiance rather than reading, but it helps you through it rather than making you go off on your own. In short, if your new to max then buy this book."
2,"Great! Must have it!: This book is a hands on training. It covers every aspect of the software. Excelent source for those who want to learn 3D Studio Max."
1,"Not worth watching. Stopped after 50 minutes.: The movie started out poorly and went down hill from there. I was waiting for it to get better and realized after 30 minutes it was only going to get worse. Stopped after 50 minutes. I just could not waste any more time on this movie. If you read reviews before watching a movie and there are this many bad reviews, don't watch."
1,"passable movie yet the inplausible situations cannot be ignored: This movie is slightly digestible yet, for having ""A list"" actors and an acclaimed director, I have to review it tougher than usual.This movie is about a police officer that crosses the line. He steals, rapes, pillages and partners up with his adverseries. It's marginally entertaining but completely unbelievable...and that is the probem that I had with the flick. Nicolas Cage's character seems like he would have been extinguished right when he started acting like a nut.In a crime drama, there must be some semblance of reality of which this had none.The ending was terrible in this entertaining yet totally unbelievable movie. Werner Herzog is excellent with man-eating bears, obessessed opera lovers, cool nature flick and POW escape plots but, he was out of his element on this one."
1,"Bad, just bad.: Bad Acting, Bad Camera Work, Bad Editing, Bad story line. Sigh. Being a native New Orleanian, I had great hope for the movie. But it is just a waist of time to watch this."
1,"Drawn out: After reading the reviews I was excited to watch this film. I found the plot to be very drawn out, predictable, and somewhat dull. I would recommend watching this if you have 2 hours of your life that you don't mind squandering and don't care if you come away from that wasted time with nothing to show for it. Enjoy the film."
1,"Good acting but plot is stupid and it is not in any sense likable.: I usually like Nicolas Cages' work. He's a fine actor. However, his acting just couldn't save this rather stupid 2009 film in which he is cast as a drug addicted detective in post-Katrina New Orleans. No doubt he has a complicated life. His girlfriend is a prostitute, his father is a recovering alcoholic and his father's wife likes to drink a whole lot of beer. His world is one of drug addiction and corruption and there's not a single character that is in any sense likable. To top this all off, it is so boring that I fell asleep. Definitely not recommended."
1,"Booooooring: Alright, this movie is boring. I watched it hoping that it would get better and it didn't. I had a lot of high hopes for this movie based on the reviews I read before watching it. Yes, Nick Cage did a good job with what he had and Eva as always is beautiful but that is pretty much the highlight of the movie."
1,"It doth suck.: I found this movie pathetic at times. The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it. The director's failed attempts at being ""artsy"" with the alligator, iguanas and the like was obvious and remedial and any action to be David LynchY was lost on practically anyone except perhaps the director.As you may surmise, this won't be one in my permanent library."
1,"trying hard but fail to impress: If you want to watch this, the better option is to rent it. It has nothing to do with the original. It stands on its own. Between the coke-takings and the iguanas and the alligators, there's not enough punch to make this film emerges as a great film to be bought and re-watch again in my book. There were a lot of potentials, but the director takes the easy way out with an already thin plot. Nicholas Cage was ok, too bad Fairuza Balk had only 2 scenes. Eva Mendes and Val Kilmer's talents were wasted. Just everage to such a promising start of a might-be-an-awesome film. Just ok, but not memorable at all."
1,"I'd give it a zero if it would let me: Total trash, not worth the dvd it's written on. Horrific acting, crazy stupid scripting and terrible camera work. It's telling me I need to write more words to make the review count so I'll reemphasize that this movie is a complete total waste of time and energy and you should stay away from it. Don't waste your time!"
2,"love it: great movie!!! cage is a great druggie i mean for being a cop. what a way to gain trust from the bad folk's."
2,"A hoot: This is a highly amusing movie shot and acted superbly. It reminds me of David Cronenberg's work. That and other reasons probably explain this movie's 98 reviews and 46 Likes vs 19 reviews and 5 Likes forMy Son, My Son, What Have Ye Done?(cf my review). It is incredibly satisfying and must have been a lot of fun to make."
1,"Glad I have prime and it was free: Wife is a huge cage fan...This was torcher to watch....I would have given less than 1 Star if it was possible..Wish I went to the dentist instead of watching this movie... I have seen some bad movies but this one now has the honor of been the worst..."
1,"Just Don't: Bad. Just bad. Somebody was on drugs during the making of this movie, I suspect it may have been multiple people. lol"
1,"Is this movie a joke?: Couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. The acting, the plot, everything... completely just... BAD. Why do people enjoy this movie?"
1,"Crap: This is a crap movie. Totally unbelievable, totally depraved. A piece of Hollywood junk. Don't bother, unless my description sounds enticing to you."
1,"Huge Waste of Time: Clean your house instead. Glad it was free! Would have regretted spending money on it. Tried to resume watching three times - couldn't' do it."
1,"Terrible!: Probably a decent story line but Nicolas Cage just needs to stop doing movies. The acting was just horrible. I would like the time back I used to watch this movie."
1,"junk: I tried giving this movie a chance... watched it all the way thru... even though I was going to shut it off multiple times... this is probably the worst movie I've watched ever..."
1,"bad isn't fitting: can not believe I watched the whole movie, I kept hoping it could get better. Never did get any better, only worse"
2,"One of 2010's Best films: Get this movie!! If you like Quentin Tarantino, you'll love this incredible ride of a film. Cage is nothing less than brilliant."
1,"Worst Movie EVER!: Horrible Movie, worst I have ever seen! Nick Cage's career is definitely over if it wasn't before this piece of garbage!"
1,"AWFUL!: I have to say, this was the WORST Nic Cage movie I have ever seen! The director is horrible, it looks like a cheap movie and why waste your time? And Val Kilmer, dude, lose some weight, you make me want to start working out more just seeing you! He looked his best in Top Gun, but ever since that movie, and Batman, he has let himself go! I am not trying to judge, but he used to be nice to look at...DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! I am glad it was free thru the Prime, thank goodness!"
1,"not good: the service was good on this movie.. came quickly and in timely mode.. but the movie sucked.. it started off good.. but in the middle.. it lost its appeal.. he was a bad lieutenant.. but it just didn't catch and keep my eye.. and towards the end.. it was like.. what is going on.. it changed completely from the beginning..N. Cage is good actor.. but Eva.. she really didn't have a plot..."
1,"SUCKS: this movie was the longest...boring movie i have ever seen. i didn't think he could ever do a horrible movie till this one. the whole movie shows him getting high and going on trips and setting people up for his mistakes...its a bunch of crap! maybe it would be good for someone that is really stoned out of their mind to sit down in watch."
1,"Lost: 121 minutes: Well, that's 121 minutes of my life I'll never get back. Last year, I was compelled to see an animated movie about guinea pigs saving the world. It was the worst movie I ever saw. Now, it's the second worst movie I ever saw. Do yourself a favor and give ""Bad Lieuenant"" a miss."
1,"Dumb, Bad, Really Bad: This was one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I usually enjoy Nicholas Cage movies but this is so far beneath him I can't imagine why he would even do it."
2,"All Nicolas Cage: He is such a good actor that he can take this ""plot"" and make a good movie out of it."
1,"Genius? Puh-lease! It's self gratifying garbage: I generally like Nick Cage even in his bad movies. This bad movie leaves very little to like about Nick or Herzog. Poor plot development is left to be interpreted by the visual arts and the script is even worse. Say whatever the other reviewers want, but I hated this movie."
2,"Drowning at midnight: I enjoyed this. Get to see N Cage in a role where he can wallow in his manic phase shtick...a wonderful diversion from typical film normalacy. He starts off living in a nightmare, and somehow dives deeper and deeper into an overwhelming whirlpool of desperation and threat. It all takes place in New Orleans, a city where dissipation is a career. During the lowest part of Cage's crash dive, Herzog includes some bizarre shots of alligators and iguanas. Disconcerting, but an interesting visual evocative of his mindset at the moment. This film is a mesmerizing ride to hell, with Cage as the perfect conductor. There is a light at the end of all this, preventing this film from existing only as a compleat downer."
1,"Awful: It's just an awful movie. It's not quite as bad as 'Eye of The Beholder' starring Ewan McGregor, but pretty close. Awful acting by Kilmer, Mendez, and Cage. I'm not sure how anyone can rate this more than 1 star, but if that's what floats your boat. Save yourself a couple of hours of your life and watch paint dry or something along those lines and you'll be better off for it."
1,"Horribly Bad: Begs comparisons to Keitel's original and fails on every level. It never creates sympathy for the gritty immoral world this cardboard cutout inhabits. It's easily Cage's worst performance and the all time worst use of music in a drama ever. Unlike man of steel Keitel, this clown would have overdosed or been shot 10 times over. Any rookie cop could point out a dozen giant plot holes."
1,"Bad Lieutenant: Terrible movie from beginning to end, I stuck with this to see if it would get better but no! two hours later I wished I had gone out side and washed the car"
1,"Bad Lieutenant = Bad Movie: I gave up on this thing halfway through. I just could not watch any more. Cage runs around in a badly cut suit, his head turned at an angle as if he can't hear the director, and there is no discernible plot or purpose. We don't notice Cage's bad acting the way we did in Wicker Man, because all the rest of the actors are so bad Cage does not stand out. One good thing about the movie is, Cage plays a coke addict. The bad thing about it is, he didn't OD and give us all a break.We can give this one a pass, though."
1,"Very Bad Movie: Till now I've never seen a bad Nicolas Cage movie, this would be the first. We kept hoping it would end and will never watch it again."
1,"The Worst Movie Ever: SAVE YOUR MONEY!!! This movie only goes to show that Nicolas Cage and Val Kilmer are definitely washed up as actors. I wish I could get my money and my time back on this movie. I just want to put my eyes out with a cordless drill thinking how much I watched of this trash before turning it off."
1,"Horrible Lieutenant: Worst Nicholas Cage movie ever made. See the Harvey Keitel version for a great watch."
2,"Very good heart wrenching story: I read this book many years ago. I was touched by her story. I can not speak for the Kindle formatting on this. Only to the books content. Excellent."
2,"Now I'm confused ;-): I read this book 24 years ago, after having just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about."
1,"Review of book: I didn't care for this book at all - in fact, I stopped reading it several times because it droned on and on about the writer's depression - so much so, it made me depressed! I wanted to read about her recovery - and after more than half of the book behind me, I was still looking for that. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone!"
2,"Liked it: This was a fascinating look at mental illness. I could really feel her pain and understand how easy it would be to slip into this state."
1,"Needy: She seemed to be ""ill"" when it was convenient for her. All I kept thinking about was how she should have thanked her lucky stars that she and her family could afford all that treatment.I really kind of wanted to smack her and say Snap out of it!"
2,"realistic: I found this book very realistic. As someone who suffers from mild mental illness, it made alot of situations real to me. I enjoy the NYC mentions as I have recently visited New York. I could visualize the book well."
1,"dry: This book was really dry... there were a couple interesting moments but most of the book was a lot of unnecessary words. This is one of the very few books that I didn't finish!"
1,"great book BUT DONT BUY THIS VERSION: Not sure exactly what went wrong here - but this version of the book is RIDDLED with laughable typos. Horrible punctuation, missing words, random periods thrown in everywhere. ""ERIC"" becomes ""ERIE"" throughout. What the hell? Was this reprinted by monkeys?DONT BUY THIS VERSION."
1,"Out of date: fading fast: When written, this books topic was well known. Individuals and styles of communication were well understood.With time, the people and places Con Price refers to are only familiar to a few local individuals-and only important in regards to this fund of knowledge.I am currently working with Dr. William Thackery of MSU-Northern, Havre, Montana to upgrade and update the book and subscript the text for improved reading, relevance, and accuracy. Once done this text may be a leading contribution to the history of Montana and Southern Alberta.Yours,Ruth M. Burleigh P.O.Box 608 Chinook, Montana 59523 (406)357-4255"
2,"Also useful if you live in Europe: You read a lot of books, when you have a relative with lung cancer. This book gives you an overview of the most common options you have, without the depressing statistics about lung cancer. If you fight for your health, statistics aren't that important after all.However, there are a lot of pages about coping with cancer 'socially', which may be important to some people, but that is information I was not really looking for. And the health system in de USA is a different from the system in Europe (dealing with doctors, insurance, that kind of things).But it is by far the best introduction book about lung cancer I have been reading so far. I keep using it over and over again. So: recommended, also if you live in Europe."
1,"VERY limited lifespan: I loved this when I first started using it and recommended it to everyone -- but after very limited use, it was totally shot. Either the keys didn't respond at all or if you pressed one key, multiple letters appeared (""a"" became ""as""; ""q"" became ""qw"") and it was impossible to return. One friend who also purchased it had exactly the same problem within a month, so it wasn't just a bad unit.If I coud give it NO stars, I would."
2,"Mean Guns: This movie is not for everyone. The story line is good but some parts of the movie are just to far fetched to make this a great movie. But if want something different like watching a solid 90 minutes of over a hundred people geting shot, stabbed ,and/or beaten to death. THIS IS A MUST SEE MOVIE!"
1,"Dumb Guns...but great soundtrack: Christopher Lambert and Ice-T are supposed to be the stars here, but what little depth this movie has comes from Michael Halsey, who turns a professional killer into a sympathetic figure (and that ANYONE can earn any sympathy in this bit of video treacle is itself an achievement).If you're not a big fan of bloodless, mindless gunplay, the only reason to buy this movie is for the soundtrack. Mambo fans will actually enoy it, as well as the Andean flute/guitar instrumental."
1,"Mean Guns Doesn't Mean Any Good: This film is a travesty of the action-adventure genre. First off, the plot is illogical and absurd even if it might be a policeman's dream: all the major criminals around congregate at a prison and kill each other in one enormous shootout. That essentially is the plot of the movie.Adding to the ""fun"" is excruciating, repetitive dialogue where the major characters attempt to bare their souls. At the end of these long-winded discourses, one fervently wishes these characters to be brutally killed for being so insufferably boring and pretentious.Oh yes, how can one forget the equally irratating mambo-inflected film score which blares loudly. and repetitively, over the soundtrack? Unfortunately, it's not loud enough to drown out the dreadful dialogue.Mean guns doesn't mean a thing."
1,"In a Nutshell: Mambo Murder: I've now seen the film Mean Guns twice and I have even purchased the DVD (albeit off of a bargain rack). This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in."
1,"A very strange and bad movie: Albert Pyun has his own way of making films. He is responsible for ""Omega Doom"" and ""Crazy Six"", two movies that in spite of having quite different plots, possess in common the peculiar and curious way with which the director accomplishes his works. ""Mean Guns"" follows the Pyun's formula: many shootings and closes in slow motion,different and weird camera moviments, strange characters and a poor script. In this film, Lambert is a murderer who,along with other criminals, is trapped inside a prison and he needs to survive before his chances drain. Pyun substitutes idea and good-sense for excellent action scenes, that remind plenty of John Woo and Sam Peckinpah's best efforts. Unhappily, that is not enough to maintain the interest for this bad film."
1,"Completely UNREVISED AND OUTDATED!: I was very disappointed in this book. I have found shop set up for effecient layout and dust collection to be the most important aspects of my woodworking. I am always looking for new and innovative ways to be as effecient and effective in these areas. I could find no difference in this book and the earlier version it replaces. Even the photos are same outdated photos that appear to be taken in the late 70's used in the 2001 release. Please, Taunton, don't insult your readers by continuing to regurgitate the same information with a shiny new label in an attempt to sell more books. Please strive to produce new and relevant photos and information. Your books and magazines are already some of the most expensive, it would be nice if the quality matched."
1,"OK if you have an unlimited budget and dream: Lots of great ideas for those with unlimited budgets. Many of the suggestions are not within the economic means for those thinking about setting up a shop; although the author includes many photo's for the ""Dream"" shop. Most references to tools include equipment that costs $1,000's (or more!). Lot's of fluff from the author and plentiful color photos of shop layouts, tools, and equipment that the average ""Joe"" would spend decades purchasing. Not too much ""practical"" information about ""The Practical Guide to Designing and Building Your Dream Shop"". Definately a dream."
1,"A lovely book, but short on specifics.: This is a beautiful book and terrific fun for a woodworker to read for enjoyment, but it's short on specific solutions. Attempting to be all things to all woodworkers, it is of little value to anyone--except to spark the imagination. The best part of the book are the beautiful photos that peek inside the workshops of great artisans around the country. But if you seek step-by-step advice, look elsewhere."
2,"Excellent and informative: This is a very clear, thorough, well-written book. It details many aspects of setting up a small wood shop, from layout to electrical work to insulation and soundproofing. The author also talks about what tools to select and suggests a priority order for people who cannot get all they want at once. It is an excellent source of information for anyone from hobbyists to beginning professionals."
2,"Packed with info: I was looking for a book about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. There one chapter on general tools that one would need, but that's it. The rest is dedicated to preparing a space for a woodshop. There is a lot of attention paid to outbuilding-type 'dream' shops most of us will never have, but electricity, surface treatment, storage, etc. are all still applicable. Every chapter is a reference itself. The table of contents is clear and makes it easy to find what you may be interested in."
2,"Very useful eye candy...: Yep, there are a lot of ""dream shops"" in this book. But ton's of ideas for those of us that are ""monitarilly challenged"". I found a lot of good ideas for storage and space utilization from the pictures and text. Admittedly the most of the shop layouts will not work for me, but I can sure use bits and pieces. I didn't buy this book, got it at the library, but I believe I will buy it just as a reference for ideas. Recommend it highly for just this reason."
1,"Not worth it: Fairly poor. Lots of photos of badly set up shops, and ego-stroking of the shop owners, but no guidance on how to lay out a shop well."
1,"weak advice: The best thing I found in this book is the picture on the cover. Well, actually the uncropped version in chapter 5. Beyond that, I found everything else to be non-practical from a design perspective. A photo of a filthy dust collector area when discussing the advantages of central collection or electrical wiring that would never pass inspection is typical. I'd rather see plan views of real shops that work with reasons for the decisions made."
2,"Nearly Sanders Best: It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an ""ambient"" percussion section that makes you want to say ""laswell is a genius."" This is followed by an ""afro-pop"" song/rap that makes you want to say ""why does Laswell have to mess with everything."" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the ""smooth jazz"" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes."
2,"Great CD: This is a great CD. Buy It. (You know you want to) Every track is hip and contain a variety of styles and elements from great vocals to some of the more ""out side"" stuff. This CD can be enjoyed by people who are not hard core jazz fans."
1,"He who doesnt laugh at this cd must have a hart of stone!: This record discusted me, mr Sanders ought to think less about money and care more for the quality of the music! I mean, this man has played with Coltrane and obviously he didn't get it. Dont buy this cd, its popular music in its worst sense. Instead you should buy a record with John Coltrane. In his latet period he is in to the same themes as Sanders but shows that this doesnt necessarily lead to kitsch."
1,"Avoid: I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."
2,"Good stuff: I have always had trouble finding the perfect toner for my skin type. I have oily skin but it is also extremely sensitve to burning and tingly toners that contain alcohol in the ingredients. I have tried a lot of toners, and this is truly one of the best ones I have ever used IMO. It is very gentle and does not produce a burning or tingly sensation after application. It has a great, light, clean scent and does an effective job of wiping away any remaining oils/dirt on your face. I like to use it after cleansing and prior to any day/night moisturizers."
2,"Amazing: Within 24 hours of using this product there is already a huge difference in my skin. I love it! It's light, it smells great, and it really does what it claims to do."
1,"Can you do basic math and science, MGM?: Mad Max and Escape From New York are two titles I would consider essential to have in my BD collection, but I will not be buying them in their present state. Why, you ask? Let us do some simple science and maths:Science in the sense of positing a fact: I watch all my discs on a 50"" plasma television, and listen to them with a receiver that decodes 7.1 channel lossless soundtracks via the HDMI ports.Hence, Blu-ray + DVD = NOT GETTING MY MONEY.It really is that simple, MGM and anyone else who is contemplating force-feeding consumers what I now refer to as a holdback format. I have already imported Alice In Wonderland and Iron Man 2 from Amazon.com because the locals tried to force me to buy a DVD. So when the UK Amazon offers Mad Max and Escape From New York without force-fed DVDs, guess who is getting my money?DVD is dead. Face up to it. It died the day that BD spoke up and offered us the experience of progressive television."
2,"Is this remastered version?: What a beautiful picture than I thought before buying this. No computer image, no sfx, natural good old film. I love this film."
2,"VERRRRRYYYYYYY GOOD: This movie is so freaking action packed, you actually are asking for a break from it and when you get your break , this movie hits you with one of those really hard to take drama scenes.but the action is the reason to watch this. The camera work is outstanding the way they follow the motorcycle in one scene is really a rush just watching it. It opens up with action and gives you just enough to make it a really good movie.One of the MANY reasons I love this movie is the hero. I watch a lot of kungfu, and this type of storyline for mel is kungfu at it's finest. He really reminded me of a guy like Jimmy Wang Yu or even one of my favorites Chen Kwan Tai(baddie from crippled avengers). Mel plays the role just as good as any of them and maybe better.The commentary is also listenable and a pretty good making of."
2,"Mad Max to the Max! Well, almost.: What can I say. This movie ROCKS BIG! It is full of fighting, bad words, threats, cool heroes, evil villains, and everything else that makes an action movie good. Like guns, bladed weapons and determination. It follows a man who means to stop criminals and terrorists in similar ways to the Punisher. It has cool quotes and good graphics for a 70's movie, and I liked it a lot so I am looking forward to the sequels, Road Warrior and Beyond Thunderdome. If you like bang em up movies with morals, see it."
1,"Cult classic...: There is no doubt that this is a cult classic, and there is plenty of reason for it to stay that way. Overall, it was predictable and somewhat lacking in screen presence. I can't really put my finger on what it is that makes the film worth the purchase, but I will admit that it is an interesting example of Australian movie making in the 70's.The story line is somewhat disturbed and there are significant reasons to not allow children to watch this, and really, there is little reason for me to suggest that anyone not completely bored with other avenues of moviemaking watch it either."
2,"I LIKE TURTLES: I LIKE TURTLES. And Mad Max. Excellent movie. I like very much. I love him. And the bad guy was good in Farscape."
2,"Great movie: a good collection and will be a long time favorite a movie to be never forgotten. Mel is a good actor"
2,"Fitting beginnng of an epic: ""Mad Max,"" the first film in a much-imitated but never equalled ""action"" tragedy/trilogy, perfectly sets up the following two movies. Together, they form an epic of one man's losses of all he loves, his ruthless revenge, and his eventual redemption, beginning in ""The Road Warrior,"" when he grudgingly assists a commune whose members repay him with treachery. Despite that, his metamorphosis comes to fruition in ""Thunderdome,"" in which Max regains his humanity to the fullest degree.Side made several in Australia before this one, and the one to see is ""Tim,"" in which Mel gives an incredible performance that's about as opposite of an apocalyptic anti-hero as anyone could get. This man has amazing talents, to the ""Max."""
2,"PLEASEEEEEEE: IF WHAT YOU SAID KENNETH MARBURY IS TRUE, EVERYONE GET TOGETHER AND TRY TO GET THIS DIRECTOR'S CUT WITH THE ORIGINAL ACCENT AND THE CUT SCENES."
2,"Buy It!: The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge."
2,"CLASSIC ACTION MOVIE: Featuring a fresh faced Mel Gibson as a young cop who faces down mobile savages on the highways of a dystopian Australia of the future. Mad Max managed to make a virtue of its modest budget, with some startling, influential stunt work and array of weird and surreal characters. Mel Gibson is perfect in the role of the idealistic young cop who feels that he is slowly becoming dehumanised by the brutality he is embroiled with on a daily basis. He quits the force and takes off with his family to try and escape from the madness and decay that is nearing fever pitch. However when his family are killed by a gang of marauding bikers, Max becomes the very thing he was trying to avoid, a broken, monoslylabic, avenging angel in souped up pursuit car. Very much a character in the vain of Clint Eastwood's man with no name from the spaghetti westerns, Max is a brooding, intense man with a capacity for terrible violence."
1,"Warning - badly dubbed dvd: Prospective purchasers should note that this dvd is the dubbed version where American actors replace the Australian actors on the soundtrack. I understand that the decision to overdub the part was done when the movie was first released in the US (an Australian friend recalled his shock at the dubbing when he saw it in a US cinema at the time) but I would have thought that the studio could have dug up the original Australian version and released that instead. Because of this irritating and pointless feature of an otherwise fine movie (the best of the Mad Max series), I can only rate the dvd 2 stars."
2,"The Special Edition has arrived - BUY IT NOW!: This review refers to the new Special Edition DVD that has just been released.Both widescreen and full screen versions are included, but more importantly, the original Australian dialogue has finally been restored. The difference between that and the clunky, awkward American-dubbed audio most of us are familiar with is like night and day (and if you want to find out for yourself, both are included on the disc, so feel free to compare).Rounding out the package is a making-of featurette, several trailers, and a ""pop-up video"" style subtitles-option which presents various minutea about the film and its locations while you watch."
2,"Mad Max (Special Edition): I won't go into a review of the movie itself as there are many on here already. I knew the movie before buying it, liked it, which is why I bought it.This review is to let folks know about the Special Edition. For those of you looking for it, yes, this has the original Australian audio. It also happensto have the English dubbed version, just so you can remember what it was like being little and watching this on TV for the first time. Plenty ofextras and great quality, this made for an excellent 'guys night'.One thing I never really figured out about these movies... Mad Max doesn't really seem especially... mad. I mean, he's mad, but I always thoughtmad was supposed to mean crazy. He's not all that crazy. Makes for great alliteration though."
1,"Cut Version: Guess I should've known better than to buy a ""special edition"" This has scenes edited out. I'm very disappointed, what a prude sissyfied country America is these days. ZERO stars for this version. Original version gets FIVE!"
2,"typical chick flick: What you're looking at here -- or at least, the product I think I'm writing this review for -- is the very first ""Mad Max,"" the one that put a young Mel Gibson on the map. The later one, though, ""Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome"" is the one everybody knows.This one is low-budget filmmaking at its best.Two points:1. For some absurd reason those who put out this DVD decided to dub the original ""Australian"" into American English. What an insult. Really, how dumb do they think we are?2. Interesting that while in the popular imagination the Mad Max paradigm has come to mean post-Apocalyptic chaos, in this first one, the world is more or less as normal as the Apocalypse hasn't occurred yet.3. How'd they get that music? Wow. That was an impressively well-done score.4. Film was crying out for aerial shots! Too bad they apparently couldn't afford a crane or helicopter."
2,"Solid Prequel to Superior ""Warrior"": Finally this thing has been enhanced for surround. It is about GD time!!! Lacks one star because Road Warrior takes it one step to the next level of high intensity. Interceptor motor kicks butt on the old surround sound rear channels too!"
2,"Post Apocolyptic Action At Its Best: A post-apocolyptic wasteland. Peace officers in hopped-up hotrods. Renegade bikers. What else does a film need to offer to be a five star masterpiece?! One of GIbson's earliest films, Mad Max continues to be one of his greatest achievements, both as a film and as a character. I give this film five big stars! This is a must see film."
2,"Great work! Fuel injected suicide DVD!!: Wish I have a MAD MAX 2 DVD like this!! This is a great DVD, with the 2 versions on it!! the American dubbed version is a great wild cartooned movie. And when I hear the true Australian version... the movie becomes more serious and real!! amazing. Some of my friends prefered the old dubbed version, but I prefered the 2 versions!! The Stereo sound of the engine of the yellow interceptor when Max is waiting for the knight Rider is superb. The image is the best, and this DVD have the choice to see the movie in 16:9 or in a 4:3, wish all DVDs have this option when movies are filmed in wide screen. If you like Muscle Cars crashing, runing, etc. you must see this..."
2,"Mad Max (1979): A catalyst in the Contemporary Era revenge-actioner movement, this George Miller flick features a young, then-unknown Mel Gibson in only his second movie role, as top-cop Max Rockatansky. After a pursuit of Max's ends in a fiery crash, killing the pursued (a biker named Nightrider), he is targeted by motor-terrorists for the death of their fellow gang member. When Max goes on a vacation trip with his wife and their infant son, they are attacked by the malicious, vengeful mob, leaving Max a childless widower hungry for his own violent revenge--and that's exactly what he gets. Set in post-apocalyptic Australia, this film, made for a meager $400,000, held the highest cost-profit ratio of any film in Hollywood history until 1999, when Blair Witch surpassed its mark."
1,"Dubbed into American English: This DVD is the U.S. release, in which the original Australian dialog (including Mel Gibson's) was replaced with dubbed dialog in ""American English""."
1,"Blah: I thought this movie was boring and it didn't let you get to know any of the characters. The only good thing in this movie is a young, cute Mel Gibson."
2,"Mad Max is Cult Classic: How can you not love this cheesy low-budget film from down under? Mel is great as Max, whose family is killed by a nomadic biker gang. The heartless and stone cold Max sets out bent on revenge, hence ""Mad"" Max. Violence is as plentiful as the high-octane chase scenes."
2,"This is where ""road-rage"" originates!: If you worry about how much you pay for gas, read this book! END"
1,"Nothing more than car crashes: Why on earth would anyone give this movie three and a half stars (out of the traditional four star system)? I kept watching this tedious film, hoping that perhaps the answer might be found in the next scene. This is a confused, jumbled mess. It's an unintelligible, incoherent, impenitrable story that makes absoloutley no sense and goes from nowhere to nothing. Each scene seems to have nothing to do with the one before or after it. As best as I can figure it out, it's a wierd cross between ""Duel"" and ""Death Wish"", but no where near as good as either. The action is disappointing too,unless you like seeing vehicles getting wreaked."
2,"Mad Rod: For a long time i've been waiting for this dvd, it becames my way of life, i bought a CB750 and a F-100 V8. These kind of vehicles really amaze me."
2,"Cult Classic: In the near furture, the high ways of tomorrow are no longer a safe place. Gangs of bikers and kamikaze lunatics roam the long stretches of road that populate the stretch of land known as the Austrailian outback. Mel Gibson soars as the tough futuristic cop Mad Max in this extreme action thriller that started it all. Amazing non-computerized stunts make this movie a treat to watch over and over again. After his wife is brutally murdered by an evil group of bikers, Max sets out on a crazed revenge, earning his heading ""Mad"". Grinding action sequences and Gibson's cool headed attitude make Han Solo look like second hand trash. Just like what Star Wars did for sci-fi, this movie revolutionized action movies for all time, setting the standard of today."
2,"Cool early effort of Mel Gibson: Mad Max is a very good movie.It's loaded with action,and it's got a good(but kind of strange)musical score that really adds to the feel of the movie.The plot is pretty good.It takes place sometime in the future(at least from when the movie was made)in Australia.The highways of Australia have become very unsafe,with biker gangs running wild.Most of the film is about a very nasty gang,led by a crazy guy called the Toecutter,that is out for revenge on a cop named Max,who they blame for the death of their friend the Nightrider.(he died in a fiery crash toward the beginning of the film,after an excellent chase)After the gang kills Max's wife and baby,he becomes the hunter,and the gang the hunted,and Max gets revenge in the end.This is a very good film,done on a very small budget.The only version I've ever seen is the American,I would love to see the Australian Sometime.This movie is followed by an excellent(and bigger budget)sequal,The Road Warrior."
1,"Mad Max 1: I'm a great fan of the Mad Max series of films and since I'm living in Australia, I have seen the original Aussie version on video locally. It seems stupid that we can only get Mad Max 2 and 3 on DVD in Australia and not Mad Max 1 (which is only available on Video). So, because of this I bought Mad Max 1 (The U.S Version DVD) through Amazon which has the American voices dubbed over the original sound track (which I didn't know at the time). Me being Australian and having watched the original, I found the U.S version very disappointing. Also the picture quality on this US version DVD of Mad Max 1 should have been better (It's more like VCD quality). The Australian version of Mad Max 1, I would give 5 stars."
2,"The best of the Mad Max triolgy: The Australian dialog was dubbed because it was believed by the director that the Aussie dialog wouldn't be understood by American audiences. This is by far the best of the trilolgy. The leader of the motorcycle gang is absolutely frightening. I think the dubbing and the orchestrated soundtrack actually ADDS to the 'alien' feel of the movie. We are watching cultural shock where ANYTHING goes, and it keeps you on edge throughout the movie. FOUR stars ONLY because it doesn't include the original Australian dialog. The sequels are wannabes and don't deserve a SINGLE star."
1,"Mad Mel: I wouldn't waste a single red cent on anything that this jew hating,racist,woman abuser acts in.This guy is a complete and utter psychopath!"
1,"This film is horrible: As a fan of post-apocalyptic movies, I must say that this movie is as far from post-apocalyptic as a post-apocalyptic movie can get. The majority of the movie is explained on the back cover- Mad Max is a cop whose family has been killed and he must seek revenge. But the seeking revenge part is just about 4 or 5 scenes towards the end of the movie! And to top it all off it seems like the apocalypse has had absolutely no effect on the world, because trees are growing, there's power, water, civilization, medicine, and ice cream! Jeez!"
1,"Possibly the worst movie I've ever seen: I thought this was going to be a good movie. Rotten Tomatoes gave it a 95%. It's the worst highly rated movie I've ever seen. My girlfriend and I kept saying ""WTF?"" the entire time we watched it. It made very little sense. The Road Warrior is much, much better."
1,"Don't buy this version it is DUBBED for the America Market: It is unfortunate that this film was ever DUBBED. It is not as though Aussies speak another language and Yanks aren't intelligent enough to work some the careful crafted slang in this classic.Fortunate now there is a new UNDUBBED version due for release this mouth, with more features and CHEAPER.I'm selling my old DUBBED copy and buying the new UNDUBBED version."
1,"Not worth buying!: I am a huge Mad Max fan, so when I found this copy I was really happy (it's hard to find in store) I waited for it to get delivered and sat down with the partner to watch, only I was so disappointed when it was finished as they have cut out half of the original movie!!!Majority of the major scenes are no where to be seen!!I must admit this is the first time I have been let down by Amazon, but with such a classic movie (with the correct rating) why was there any reason to cut out soooooo much of it, for a person who may not have seen this before, they would have no real idea as to what the movie is!!!"
2,"Gives you a nice urban 'western' type film - Mel , not Clint: This film will give those who never thought much of Australian films either more fuel for the fire or a wake up call .This is a classic and I suppose there are some who would call it a cult film , but it is full of intense performances and whilst not science fiction , it does have an otherwordly quality to it .Forget Mel Gibson is in it - watch this film for its own brand of drama , revenge , thrills , action and good old fashioned mean-heartedness .If you think about it , the plot for this film was recycled for 'Gladiator' , which was another breakthrough film for an actor from the Aussie part of the world .Buy and enjoy this distinctive film on DVD , with a healthy and worthwhile dose of extras ."
2,"Great: Bought for my BF. He really loves Mad Max. Figured I'd just go with the blueray-DVD combo since the price wasn't bad."
2,"not as go as the road warrior,but a very good low-budget action movie: in this first mad max movie mel gibson(looking very young) is a cop in the near future where war and crime is pushing the world into a new and deadly dark age. motercycle gangs roam the road ways and sack and pillage everything they can get their hands on! after several run ins with them,max sends his wife and child away to protect them,only to have the gang find them and kill them in a most unpleseant way. now max,half mad,sets out to kill them all,at any cost!while not as great as the road warrior,this is a dandy little revenge movie and has some great stunt driving! this sets up the reason why max is so cold and mean in the road warrior and it makes the road warrior that much better if you see this one first.the transfer is great and the use of the non dubed soundtrack helps make this one you need! check it out!!!"
2,"Good revenge-type movie: If you did not know it starred a very young Mel Gibson, you would have never believed that it was really him. This movie was a really good revenge movie. The only problem I had with it was trying to make out what was being said. It is done in ""Australian language"" and, though it is basically English, the accents of most except for Mel Gibson's character are so strong that you really have to over-listen to try and figure out what is being said. Other than that, the movie was a good movie and the crash scenes were fantastic for the era in which it was made. I only wish I could have understood what everyone was saying without straining in order to get even half of the dialogue. But, it is a movie well worth viewing."
1,"mad max: this film is one of my all time favorites but i have to say the picture quality of the video is very poor i am needless to say dissapointed"
2,"When do we go for a ride?!: Ever since the first time I watched this movie, I have loved it. Mel Gibson is one of the greatest actors to ever come onto the big screen. I have the VHS version of ""Mad Max"", but it pales badly to the new special edition DVD. I had looked at buying an Australian version, I'm glad I waited. The best part about the DVD is the ability to either watch the American dubbed version(ick) or the Aussie version. The American dubbing really knocked out a lot of the background noise that the DVD brings out... sirens, horns, a lot of little sounds that I've never heard on the tape...believe me, I've watched this tape many, many times... I think I could recite it in my sleep... TWO THUMBS UP FOR THE DVD VERSION!!!!!!"
2,"Dubs are BAD: Do not, under any circumstances, get this movie dubbed if you have the same opportunity to get it in its original sound format, with the original voices. The original is far superior to the dubbed version, no matter how difficult the thick Australian accents of its actors may be to understand. While it is a good movie even with the dubbed voicing, it is a far better movie with all its original voices intact."
2,"Dubbing is bad: Good movie, bad dubbing. Please releast the origanl version. I took one star off becuse of the dubbing."
2,"A household name...: I loved this movie when I first saw it, and still love it, after seeing it about 30 times. So who cares if the trick blower can't be made? Everytime I think about replacing my gas guzzling 454 truck, this film reminds me that there really ain't many things in life as sweet as a rumbling V8. A perfect guy movie. For whatever reason, most women just don't get it. BE WARNED though. The original release was overdubbed with cheezy american voices. Amazon does not carry the restored version. We all know what Mel Gibson's voice sounds like, and listening to some bad voiceover now makes me want to puke. Please Amazon, carry the original, letterboxed version on VHS."
1,"Red only when off.: I replaced the amber bulbs of the turn signals with these ones. My car has clear lenses and unfortunately these bulbs are so bright that they look reddish, like washed off, they don't have enough red coating to look RED.I was looking for something to look the same color as the stop lights, these bulbs don't do it."
1,"Barely red enough: Sold as red, obviously.But I find them to be more pink than dark red. I'm sure they're still legal (or hope they are), but not the look I was hoping for / expecting.Otherwise, they work fine."
1,"The Sword in The Stone: There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times. T.H. White puts anachronisms to make it more interesting. The book was not very thrilling. The book can seem like it is never ending. But I'd say that this book is plain boring. It does have some adventure. I did not like it. I DONT RECCOMEND IT!"
1,"The sword in the sux: Well iu thin that this book should've had a first book. Its very confusing and boring its so long I did not like it !!!!!!!!!!!"
2,"The best fantasy I've ever read.: THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy"
1,"The childhood of a legendary king: The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one. The Sword in the Stone explains King Arthur's youth throughout the book. His name is Wart in the book> From the adventures he takes with the other legends and queens to the learning experiences he has as animals, you won't want to put it down.What makes this book unique is Warts learning experience. He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book. The reason is that he changes into different animals, turns invisible, and fights monsters. It is for readers 13+."
1,"A Waste of Time: This book was a WASTE OF MY SUMMER VACATION! I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone."
1,"worst book i have ever read in my life(and i read lots!!!): i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class, if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star!!!!!!! If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it"
2,"There's different versions of this story!: T.H.White must have published at least three slightly different versions of this story.When I read the full Once And Future King book a few years ago, there was no Madame Mim episode, there was a buttery version of the fairy castle (Robin Hood) episode, there was an Archimedes/Wild Geese episode, and some other minor changes/additions.When I read a paperback Sword In The Stone twenty years ago, there was a much nicer non-buttery version of the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode, and I don't think the Giant Galapas episode was there, etc.Now I've just read the illustrated hardcover Sword In The Stone edition, and the FairyCastle/RobinHood episode is replaced by an Anthropophagi/RobinHood episode, Giant Galapas is there, and the Archimedes/WildGeese isn't (its been replaced by an Archimedes/Athena episode).Anyone else notice these differences and have an explanation for them?"
2,"Thin and bends easily, but very pretty: I really liked this ring. It is very pretty and just the right size for me.The silver is very thin, however, and bends very easily. I put it on my middle finger, and when I took it off, it was bent out of shape. The good thing is that it was bent to mold to my finger and was very comfortable, even for being so wide."
2,"fairies dancing on my head: I found this cd on the shelf at my work. I'm listening to it right now. Sweet instrumentals that make me want to dance around. It reminds me of sugarplum fairies creating music in the 70's. The sound is light. The lyrics are few but this album isn't about the lyrics. It's about the rhythm it creates. It's a pleasant album."
2,"Worth the effort it might take: Ever have one of those albums?An album where you spin it a few times and a few songs might sink-in, but the majority seem wrapped in gauze? Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. ""Captain Easychord""), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it's worth the effort. (as a comparison, I found ""Margerine Eclipse"" very easy to get-into, while it took a while for ""Dots & Loops"" and ""Cobra & Phases"" to really sink-in).Very highly recommended, once it hits you, it will stay with you and grow-stronger with repeat-listens."
2,"A complex, multi-layered masterpiece: Unlike Dots and Loops, Sound Dust doesn't reach out and grab you at first. The album takes many listens to appreciate, but once you do, you'll realize it's a masterpiece. Microbe Hunters was the same way...hard to absorb at first, but eventually rewarding. Aside from the first track (a repetitive instrumental), every song is pure quality. Buy it, listen to it several times.....you won't be disappointed!!!"
1,"Not their best outting: I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday"
1,"Huh?: I loved Carabee and Moghul, and I thought Samurai would be more historical fiction, but I was sadly disappointed. I got as far as the 50% point having struggled in vain to understand all the financial concepts in which I was drowning and not giving a damn about any of the characters. And I quit!"
1,"disappointing: Hoover's choice of international financial manipulation as subject matter for this novel is timely and raised my expectations. Instead most of the story is pulpy romance surrounding a contrived conflict between Japanese investors scheming to revive Imperial Japan and American regulators intent on saving the free world. The only thing missing from this ""B"" grade movie plot are black and white hats to differentiate the bad guys from the good guys. Not at all what I had hoped for."
2,"Japanese high finance mystery: Interesting story about how Japanese business and government could take over American business and technologyRealistic people portrayed from both sides of the Pacific."
2,"Decent shoe: Good, sturdy platform for squatting under a barbell. Very firm. Laces are long enough to wrap around ankles, and back of shoe forms a fair notch to retain the laces and keep them from sliding up and off the shoes - would have been better had there been a rear loop. Shoes are better without the insoles because they put a spongy foam wedge under the heels. I replaced them with thin flat insoles from a pair of water shoes. One could cut the foam wedge and use the included insoles. There is no raised heel other than that foam wedge. They run true to size or slightly tight."
2,"Fun....: This is a fun project to do if you have a short amount of time. It's simple and easy for kids to do on a rainy day. Everything is included and it takes just a few minutes to set up and clean up.It's not a FANTASTIC, GOTTA HAVE IT item, but for the money, it's a good craft project. If you buy those magnets at a craft store, you can glue it on the back and use them on your fridge or give them away to relatives for Mother's Day or the like. :)"
2,"Fun fantasy: I love the story line of this movie - a male Fairy Godmother! What fun. And Kathleen Turner as the 'wicked witch'. What a fairy tale concept."
2,"Make a wish!: 'A Simple Wish' is a cute, fun family film. It's about a young girl named Annabel (Mara Wilson) who wishes for a fairy godmother. Her brother thinks there are no such things as fairygodmothers. Well, Annabel's wish comes half true. Instead of getting a fairygodmother, she gets a fairygodfather, instead! Anyway, soon they meet an evil fairygodmother who they try to destroy. It's very fun and really cute. I saw it on TV and it was very good. All the actors in this film give great performances, and the script is pretty good, too. I definitely recommend this film for families everywhere!"
1,"Family film: I did not really care for this film, though, it did have a few funny moments, a lot of the attempts at humor fell flat for me. I really like Martin Short, but didn't think he was very funny in this. It was a little corny. I also thought that it was going to be more of a musical, but there was very little singing, so I was disappointed in that. I also didn't like the moral behind the plot, of the wish itself--getting the little girls dad the role in the play--by using any means to sabbotage the character who had the role. I don't think that's a good message for kids, even if the methods used are done by fairy godmothers. I know a lot of shows do that, like Bruce Almighty, but in even that show, in the end he gave the newscaster's job back to the character that he stole it from. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
2,"GOOd: a gift for my friend he loved it is a child movie and could find it anywhere but here, great price and fast shipping"
2,"Cute film: This is a fun film about a girl who wants a wish, and a fairy godmother (or in this case, godfather) Her wish is not even for herself, it is for her father. However, the fairy godfather is not very good at magic, so he is unable to grant her wish right away, and falls afoul of a witch who wants his magic. Overall a fun film for kids, and adults might enjoy it too."
1,"Mara Wilson: I Love Mara Wilson she is cute and beautiful.I also loved her in Matilda. I think that Matilda was beautiful.she is a good actress.she was a cute girl in Mrs.Doubtfire.I think that she was very good at that part"
2,"A little of everything: The plot and cinematography of this film were above average, while other aspects were a little lackluster. The storyline was well written, and the casting was on target, however the mixture of computer graphics took plenty away from the film and cheapened it quite a bit. Quite dissapointing.You do get to see Martin Short in a most unusual role, and I'd consider this a must-see for any admirer of his antics. Robert Pastorelli (the crazed painter from Murphy Brown) plays a rather lackluster role. Kathleen Turner pulled off the typical ""Evil Witch"" role a little too well. Mara Wilson seemed to do a better job in ""Matilda,"" but she was good in this film nontheless.I happened to get the Italian version of this film (alternately titled ""Un Semplice Desiderio"") and I will add that watching this movie with Italian audio on adds a little to it. Granted I may have never even seen this film if it werent in a lot of videos I bought from ebay.it :)"
2,"A must see!: This movie is very entertaining to both adults and children. It is a fun and witty movie that you can watch again and again and still have a good time with! I would highly reccomend getting the video"
2,"Well worth seeing! Martin Short is excellent!: We rented the video and then went out and bought it. It's entertaining and fun for both kids and adults. If you like Martin Short, there are a couple of scenes that are really worth seeing."
2,"Happy Escapist: Call me an escapist, but I love this book. To accompany Mr. Pidgeon as he builds the Islander and sails her around the world, from one adventure to another, is a wonderful way to spend a snowy evening by the fire. He gives us a great glimpse into the flavors of the various south sea island groups in the early 20th century, where most cultures were dilluted already, but a few were intact. This book lets us see the world with wide eyed wonder through the eyes of a man with a thirst for knowledge and experience, and from the deck of a small boat."
2,"A stimulating toy but a little too heavy and hard: My daughter first started reaching for this toy at about 4 months old. However, her arm control wasn't developed enough to keep her from smacking herself in the face. Not a problem with lighter toys made from softer plastic. This one is pretty hefty and I had to keep one hand on it at all times. Now, at 6 months, she's doing better and can play with it without risking a black eye.For an older baby the toy is great. I don't think she's really into the beads yet, but that will come as she grows. For now she loves the colors and shape of the toy. It's easy to grip and makes a fun sound."
2,"Easy to hold rattle: This rattle is easy to hold and has an added advantage of being able to roll around the floor. This makes my grandson want to crawl after it. It's well made, makes a nice rattling sound. I would buy it again for my grandson as it is quite nice. He didn't show interest in it until about 7 months and now that he is one plays with it a bit. The only negative comment I have is that he loses interest in it after a very short time."
2,"Voltaire - Genius of Mockery: Voltaire Genius of Mockery book is about the life of Voltaire, French philosopher, poet and novelist. It covers his entire life from birth to death. Each page comes alive and one can picture his joys and his frustrations as he battles the repressive Catholic Church and the French monarchy over the publication of his books, his plays and his personal philosophy. Also, his fight for the rights of the persecuted is eloquently portrayed in the period just before the French Revolution. One also gets a glimpse of the life in the 18th century through his relationships with Fredrick the Great, King of Prussia, Madame du Chatelet his lover, and Louis XV, King of France. One will understand his stories, such as Candid when one knows the man and his smile."
1,"Poor quality: I ordered this clock. The first one sent to me did not work at all. The replacement worked until 4:40 and stopped. Every time I would reset it, it would tick until 4:40 and then stop. I can not recommend this at all. It's too bad because the dinosaur matched my sons room theme really well."
2,"Upbeat Christmas Songs That'll Get You In The Spirit: If you don't like Kenneth Copeland, then please don't write dumb, childish reviews that have nothing to do with the product. I just had to say it. The other reviews on this CD are purely based on their personal distaste for the man behind the songs, which is not how one rightly rates a product. ANYWAY, this CD is great fun to listen to imo, whether you like/know who Kenneth Copeland is or not. Jazzy takes on favorite Christmas songs like 'Go Tell It On The Mountain' and 'Away In A Manger' make their debut here, and they're great fun to listen to. This CD has been a part of my family's Christmases since it was released in 2004, and will continue to be. Why? Because the music is good and it gets you in the spirit of Christmas, that's why! Highly recommend this product."
1,"Ask Santa for some ear plugs: Home for Christmas. Sounds innocent enough. But you would be well advised to stay away from this home. It is a horrible place. You'll be asking Santa for some ear plugs if you purchase this cd. Alternately, you can buy it for people on your Christmas list that you don't like or just plain hate. How bad is it? Some say that the CIA used it to torture hardened terrorist suspects in Guantanamo. It had them babbling like babies in minutes. But if you are a fan of Kenneth Copeland, go ahead and buy it if you must. After all, the man has a private jet and he's gotta pay for that jet fuel somehow!"
2,"Mini Blinds something I always put off cleaning.: With this tool you can keep your mini blinds really clean, the brush reaches into those impossible crevices. And I now dust my blinds on a regular basis to keep them looking really great. I was most pleased with this product, especially since it saves me those extra steps of cleaning!!"
1,"Product did not work like I thought it would: Based on the reviews I saw, I assumed that is would be perfect for keeping my blinds clean. That was not the case at all. It does not clean the dirt off your blinds the way you would think. I am very disappointed in this purchase."
1,"Did not like: I did not like this item or how it worked. I guess it just isn't whatI wanted. It did not work like I thought it would. Attachment would notfit snuggly into vacuum hose. Was hard to insert between blinds and did notclean as well as I wanted. They were really dirty but I ended up using anotherproduct."
2,"A return to early Trout: Closer to the Truth is a cd that rekindles the emotional music of Trout Fishing in America that was prevelant in Truth is Stranger Than Fishing. Every song on Closer to the Truth is a powerful emotion. There is no bad song on this cd. The albulm starts off with Dreaming which sets the listener into a daydreaming mood and goes straight into a remeniscing melody (Old Things). A light-hearted skeptical shortly follows (Dangerous). You will be humming the chorus all day after that song. Alberta Postcard will paint you a picture and make you want to visit Canada while There You Go will bring you back to the mortality of life. The icing on the cake is the finale (The Sun the Moon and Stars). This is their best song on the CD and will bring you to tears. It took Trout 10 years to match the quality of Truth is Stranger Than Fishing, but Closer to the Truth matches it and then surpasses it in their best Adult albulm to date."
1,"Expensive: 38.39 is a ridiculous price for 12 red bull. especially considering they cost 2.09 in a store."
2,"Timeless and just Awesome!: I love Felt! great band and I have all of their recordings. This one is probably my favorite in their whole catalogue. Dreamy Psychedelic and heartbreakingly beautiful in places. I will never get tired of this recording. Maurice Deebank is an incredible underrated guitarist and Lawrence is perfect at what he does. A truly great recording that the average listener will never understand. Genius!"
2,"Johnny Zoot rocks: Although this CD has been out a while, I just purchased it. WoW!I was blown away. Johnny Zoot really rocks. I especially liked the note he sang on Cobwebs. The lyrics and feel makes me sad but that is a testament to the strong emotions which Jonathan Zoot summons from the bottom of his soul.This band would have been one of the tops in the 40's and should be today with the fine musicianship and bass/vocal prowess of J. Zoot.I have a small dentist practice in my town and have made my patients listen to this when they are tied in their chairs and they almost never complain.Thanks Zoot people."
2,"Swing! Swing! Swing!: I enjoyed the diverse ""moods"" of this CD! First and foremost was it's swing beat....then I liked the blues style. I would have to say my favorite was ""Kopasetic"" followed closely by ""Rat Face Rudy"" and ""G Man"". I enjoyed the humor that was cleverly added to the lyrics in the latter two. Some of these songs will certainly add some ""zing"" and ""pazazz"" to your day."
2,"1924-P Silver Peace Dollar: I purchased this coin for my Mother as a birthday present because it is the year she was born.It is exactly as described on the bid sheet, and I am well pleased."
1,"everybody BUT Hendrix: This video shows managers,roadies,and freinds, talking about THE MAN. NO complete songs even in the background (which is the only place the music is). If you want to see Hendrix play, it's not here."
1,"Disappointing. Too much talk...not enough music.: Only about 1 hour long, and most of this is talking. Somewhat interesting, but I wanted Dolby Digital Hendrix!"
2,"great video: hearing about how this Musical Genius made this Landmark album is a real treat.it's a timeless video about a timeless ARTIST that Trenscended music&time."
1,"Lame talk, the music speaks for itself: This is a very dissapointing DVD. If they allowed you to have songs without commentary interruption it might be ok, or if there was any 'previously unreleased' music on it. Even if they just had the pictures, film and diary entries with the music it would be ok. But there's no reason to watch this DVD more than once if you have to listen to all the commentary each time. The Band of Gypsy DVD has two options, Concert Footage only and Concert Footage with Commentary. Jimi's music speaks for itself, and no one can come close to him, so it's not necessary to hear what people have to say about him. The music and maybe the pictures as background are enough."
1,"Should be called a documentary!: I thought this would have more complete songs--like U2's Rattle and Hum or Styx's Return to Paradise. Instead it is a documentary with short clips of Jimi performing. Disappointing..."
1,"Who mixed this thing??: I was really looking forward to this one. As a fan of the Classic Album Series, I was very disappointed when I watched this one. The volume level is very inconsistent, especially during the sections where people are talking over the music. You have to turn it way up when they're talking, then be quick with the remote when the music starts or it will blow your speakers! For die-hard fans only, and keep the volume remote handy. You'll need it!"
2,"pleased with my purchase: I bought a Suburban that the previous owner had a little too much fun with. The mirror was broken and I needed a replacement. I called the dealership and gave them my vin to get the actual part number. The Left one and Right one are one number off from each other. Make sure you check with the dealer before you buy to get the actual number for the right wire harness... They wanted $450 for the replacement. I went with this one and it works fine. It doesn't have the feel of the factory one, but all of the mechanics work perfect. I recommend buying a pair. They won't match your stock one on the other side if you buy only one. But they look good together. -J"
1,"Highly disappointed: I bought this to be a part of my daughter's train set, and have been nothing but disappointed. For starters, the red circular center piece can easily be removed, and I anticipate the day it comes up missing permanently. The wood is slightly bowed, and though it does not impede play, I was expecting a higher quality of toy (this is Brio after all). The most disappointing thing, though, was how small the turntable is. I knew it would not support the larger engines (e.g. Gordon and Henry), but I was surprised that even mid-sized engines such as Edward and James would not fit. I wish I had kept the box because I would love to return this item."
2,"Peace & Positivity: This CD is blazin'. Slim Kid of the Pharcyde is really doin' his thang. Tre is rapsanging over smooth tracks. This CD won't get you Crunked....but sometimes U need to simmer down and just chill out. And this is what this CD does. Chilled, laid back, with positivity oozing from every single tracks. MC Lyte, Charlie 2na, NDea Davenport, and the ""Slam"" artist Saul Williams add their essence, making all 17 tracks a powerful blend. My favs are Ayyomyman, Roots, Love, & Culture, & Playing House...But no doubt, all tracks are hot!!!! Don't sleep on this CD."
2,"Incredible album...: Tre Hardson (of the Pharcyde), is without a doubt one talented individual...this album is incredible and should be owned by everyone interested in hip-hop and quality music...The only artist I can compare him to is K-os from Vancouver, BC...flows, lyrics, some singing...this is dope...and I listen to artists like Killah Priest, Billy Woods, Mr. Lif and Reef the lost Cauze. Peace"
1,"disappointing: I've read several Bayer novels and enjoyed them very much. After hearing that this novel won an Edgar award I was eager to read it. Well...that must have been a very thin year for Edgar nominees. This book was a severe letdown. Totally unbelievable and it got sillier and more ridiculous the more pages I read. Honestly, I can't believe Bayer would even want this one still in print. His other novels, and the ones he has written as David Hunt, are very good. But this one reads like the work of an amateur by comparison. Give it a miss."
2,"Innovative design, excellent execution ...: I am a sometime amateur turner, but due to my work situation, unfortunately I spend much more time reading about turning than turning. Not good. Gotta get that fixed.So, I've read some of the best (Raffan, Darlow, etc.), but I fould Chapman's book truly inspirational. It includes information on techniques, of course, but in doing so, seemingy inadvertently showcases a wide variety of very, very good design executed very, wery well. More importantly, from my viewpoint, almost all appears to be well within the range of an intermediate turner. Recommended!"
1,"one of the worst books I ever read: I tried to read this book when it first came out. I couldn'tfinish it. There seem to be at least three themes or storylines in here struggling to get out. One seems to be a reasonably good alternative-history novel based on the idea that the pirate subculture of the 1700s might have formed a revolutionary constitutional regime. Unfortunately, this quickly becomes mixed up with maundering about certain ancient ""cities of the red night"" and a very great deal of homosexual imagery and fantasy. As the book goes on (as far as I read it, anyway) the main storyline becomes increasingly lost. I ultimately found it both distasteful and so muddled as to not be worth it."
1,"wow, what a mess: If you read the Beats and about the Beats, you're eventually going to come to William S. Burroughs. He's very much a voice of the 1950s, post World War II. He was into the drugs, longer and harder and deeper than anyone else. He was into shocking the squares and living off the pathetic working class zombies. And it's all there on the page, man. A strong, unique voice that is still imitated decades later.Unfortunately for those of us living in the twenty-FIRST century, it's about as relevant as fins on cars. It's convoluted, drug paranoia with a created mythology about time and space travel that's all about shocking images of sex and death. It's not a story."
2,"Get Out of the Defensive Position: Cities of the Red Night is William Burrough's magnum opus, the most sublime manefestation of his genius. From the opening chapter titles and hallucinatory invocation to the exquisitely fashioned closing dream sequence, each word bears the stamp of the studiously enigmatic visionary stylist. This novel impressed itself to the point that I met one of the characters in a dream, a truly disorienting experience. Sure, it's disjointed. Innoculation to the parasitic authority of the word virus, to see and feel in another medium, whaddaya think the poor guy's tryna say here, anyways?"
1,"strange incomprehensible mess: I've never read anything by William S Borroughs, and after finishing ""Cities Of The Red Night"" I don't believe I ever will again! What a strange befuddling mess, I challenge *anyone* to be able to summarize the plot of this book for me in plain-sense English language and actually make sense. This is just a loosely-explained collection of obtuse imagery, bizarre symbolism, wandering prose, distracted dialog, and puzzling language in here....I actually wonder what brand of illicit substances the author was under the influence of when he farted out this novel. IT JUST DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE!!! That and you can hardly go a page or two without reading about either 1) shirtless adolescent boys, 2) opium, or 3) compulsive sodomy. So despite the mass confusion of his prose, I'd say #'s 1 and 3 above are why I gave the book two stars instead of just one. Cheers!"
2,"Bleeding Gums: Fierce symbolisms that rips out the guts of whitebread America. The most profound gem is Burrough's prediction of the AIDS crisis. He was able to capture in this book the symptoms he saw develop in the homosexual underground years before it was announced to the world at large."
2,"Cities Of The Red Night: Cities Of The Red Night is one of the most enjoyable books I have read. The novel has different storys that as the novel progresses intertwine. The books presents situations that are unbelievable but because of Burroughs genius you are convinced of that they are happening in a world not too far from are own. I think he was trying to show the questionableness of what is presented to us as reality. This book also has some of the most vivid pictures and unforgetable lines that I have read. It is Burroughs masterpiece."
2,"Need to understand German: Stephan Sulke is one of Germanys songwriters and story tellers. Unless you understand the german language you will not have the privilege to enjoy his music and lyrics to the fullest. The songs on this album are truely some of his best. Comming out of the artists heart and life the storys behind the songs have a bitter humor. i can only recomend this cd."
2,"Awesome!: This was the first novel I've read by Shari MacDonald. It was great. She ranks right up there with Lori Wick and Lori Copeland. This is a must read."
1,"One's own dreams are better than this!!!!!: This book is not one that you quickly get through. It is very slow and dull in both story content and happenings involved. I would not and have not recommended the book since I purchased it. Actually, I threw the copy I purchased out because I did not want to subject anyone else to the boredom! If you are one that likes slow moving and unreadable books, then this is the one for you. I did not find it the list bit funny or have any true emotion over the book at all -- except for the fact that it is a waste of money!"
2,"The Best!!!: I agree with everyone else, Rashel Jordan(the Cat) is definately an awesome character. Off all the nightworld books, this is my second favorite. Rashel is bull-headed and will not be dominated, but it is amusing to see her get knocked off her feet by her soulmate Quinn."
2,"Loved It!: I really loved this book! It has my second favorite pair of soulmates in it (Ash & Mary-Lynette being my favorite). This book reminds me a lot of my favorite show 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'. I think they even mention the movie in the book... Anyway this book up there with my top 5 favorite L. J. Smith books. They are all so good that it is hard to decide an exact order. so if you haven't read it yet then I suggest that you do."
2,"Wonderful and Dramatic: Basically, Rashel is searching for the vampire who killed her family when she was a child. She comes upon an enclave of vampires, and, ironically, falls in love with one. His name is Quinn. He is also the fosterling of the vampire who killed Rashel's family.Well written and suspensefu"
1,"This book is good but I wouldn't call it great.: I liked Rashel and Quinn, they really go together. It was cool how she hunted down vampires and killed them. I loved it when they burned down the house."
1,"Rashel: Ugh, I don't get it how all these people can like Rashel. To me she was an extremely annoying person because it always seemed like she was bragging about her ""amazing fighting abilities"". Also, she would always make these ""quips"" that were supposed to make her seem tough, impressive, and heroic but just made me feel like once again she was being annoying. The bad thing is that she is like this the entire book. The book has a nice plot and everything but if I can't stand the main character then that just ruins everything. Sorry."
2,"read mi review. sorta like ads.: this book rocks, people! however, i got reali confused withnyala's character. what's up with her aniway? split personality?aniway, i reali loved rashel and quinn though they were always at each other's throats!! enjoy this book! p.s : if u're reading these reviews to decide whether it's worth ur money, i tell ya, get it QUICK before it's all gone!"
2,"It was the best Night World book!: Compared to all the night world books this one is the best! I love how Rasheal is so brave and finds her soulmate while fighting vampires."
2,"Randy is a dog's best friend...: I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. There are few people I have encountered that are as dedicated to a cause as Randy seems to be. His devotion and tenacity are to be commended. He is doing such a great service to the city of St. Louis. There are a lot of us out there that would've never even realized there was such a stray problem in this country. I am so glad to have read this book and to be more informed on the conditions these dogs have to live in. It has been said over and over about this book, but the prevailing message is that one man can make a difference and seeing that proven in Randy's case is a great motivator for the rest of us. For anyone who loves dogs and/or loves inspiring stories, read this book."
2,"A Must Read!: Enter one very unlikely hero who is trying to call national attention to the scourge. Randy Grim was young, hip, but crippled by panic attacks and phobias (of public places, parties, elevators, driving). After rescuing his first street dog, Bonnie, he couldn't look away. ""How can I?"" he asks. ""Each one says, `Don't leave me here.'"" And so the man who must pop Xanax to walk through an airport refuses to leave a starving, terror-stricken German Shepherd on a dark, icy and stormy East St. Louis street, even when an threatening tenement resident has him on the business end of a gun.Journalist Melinda Roth puts a human, and animal, face on an ignored tragedy playing out in our cities. She gives us beautifully wrought, but too few, scenes of redemption."
2,"truly beautiful: Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time."
2,"Marie Curie - An Inspiration for All: The book is a reprint of the biography written by Marie Curie's daughter, Eve Curie in 1937. It is a book which should be read by all - especially aspiring scientists. Marie Curie was the first woman to receive a Ph.D. in France, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize and the first person to receive two Nobel prizes. The work she accomplished under the most difficult situations for a scientist is truly inspiring. When asked why she and her husband, Pierre Curie did not patent the procedure for extraction and purification of radium, something which would have made them very wealthy, she said ""No, It would be contrary to the scientific spirit."" How refreshing, since in today's world the first thought of scientists is patenting their discoveries."
2,"Great Book for Young Women: Excellent work by a woman writer who is also the daughter of Madam Curie. I would recommend this book to all young women. It is an excellent account of a great woman who made a mark on history when (supposedly) women had little freedom or power. Miss Curie (the writer) exhibits a great deal of love and devotion to her mother, yet remains objective."
2,"pistol packin' mama: Florence King is one tough broad: a meat eating, heat packing, bisexual Republican who has NO patience for whiners, slackers,huggies, fuzzy wuzzies, or anyone even remotely PC. But this stiletto sharp Southern gal can also laugh at herself and she'll make you laugh until you're breathless. George W haters will be thrilled to know she hates the sight of him. Nor does she align herself with anti-intellectual cornpone GOPS. She calls herself Conservative, but a woman who spurns (and hates) marriage and motherhood is radical in my book. She's the perfect antidote to a sea of mushy self-esteem/body image/self-help/Chicken Soup for the Soul BS. I don't agree with everything she says, but she gives me a helluva intellectual workout. You go,girl!"
1,"An odd coverage of an uninteresting event: The author points out that this series of crimes is of little importance and has largely been forgotten. It will remain so."
1,"Do not buy --This is just a chapter -- not the book .: This is just a chapter of the Volume 4. Do not buy it and save your money. These sellers are so clever that they give no mention of the pages -- hence fooling us into buying these thinking them to be books .Go buy the book -- The emergence of Industrial Societies."
2,"Kyle ""the yellow dart"" Smith's review: A BRILLIANT READ!!!! Easily the most exceptional book on religion, power, and politics in Colonial St. Augustine from the Florida Museum of Natural History. I found it gripping from front page to last. The way St. Augustine came alive, it was like i was really there. This is a must buy for anyone who finds American history thrilling. Genius! Robert L. Kapitzke is one of the most well versed authors of our time."
1,"AVOID !!!: If you want to impress your friends with your new DVD player then (...) don't show them this film. It's a straight forward copy from a video tape that will have you reaching for the tracking button (if only) and the sound is not in sync with the picture. The acting is wooden and the plot is dire. If you are fool enough to buy this, don't come crying to me when you realise I'm right!"
2,"Great Alaska singers: JoAnn and Monte are two of the best Alaska singers I have ever heard. Back in the early 80's we purchased some tapes from their show in Juneau and are sorry to find out that we can't get CD's now. It seems that nobody carries updated versions that are truly some of the best Alaska folk songs. I was thrilled to get this CD and wish I could find more."
1,"Film fails to capture the magic: The quality of filming is so poor, the beauty of the music and the singer are lost. I saw the ""30's version of this as a child, and I wish I could get that....this was a real disappointment. Munsel sings beautifully, but the film itself is boring, and the quality is poor. Unless you really, really love Munsel and the music, don't buy this film."
2,"Better than Therapy: Try this album after a rough day at work. Or better yet, while you're at work. More Eno-esque than Eno himself! This collection brings together the very best elements of Eno's Ambient Music work into clear, crystaline jems of structure. Each piece has a strict internal logic. Progressions and patterns grow organically, following the rules of nature - they feel like branches and leaves growing from a stem. Primarily synthesizers and lush vocal samples combine then dissipate into silence, as indeed they must. The pieces are rhythmic, with deceptively simple, yet haunting melodies. These guys have been producing some of the best Ambient music since the mid 90s. Hard to find, but worth the effort."
2,"Lotus Flower Purchase: Amazon makes it easy to find obscure releases from lesser known artists. The one-click shopping is easy to use. The item was shipped and received very quickly and arrived in perfect condition."
2,"Great Puzzle: My 3 year old granddaughter loved this puzzle. It is very colorful I would definitely recommend this puzzle. It is very well constructed."
1,"Substandard Product: Here is the timeline of this product:After first two plays, little wood pieces started chipping off;In about two weeks, the pictures started peeling off;In about one month, layered wood started falling apart.Will I still buy puzzle from this company? Maybe, no one else selling small puzzle set for toddlers. What choice do I have? But I do pray to God that somebody will be making a better product soon and drive Melissa & Doug out of business."
2,"Love these puzzles: I have purchased several M&D puzzles for my 3 year old granddaughter and she loves putting them together. Very durable and colors are so vibrant."
1,"Poor quality for the money: For the cost, this puzzle is not well made. The pieces were locked together so firmly that the puzzle was very difficult to get apart. The edges had visible splinters, and over the course of a few days, the tray warped to the point that it doesn't sit flat on a table. The edges of the image on the pieces began to fray immediately as the puzzle was taken apart. To make the puzzle usable, I had to spend 15 minutes sanding the interlocking edges, placing a slight bevel on the bottom of each piece. I then rubbed a white crayon on each edge surface. This made the puzzle easy to work for my 2 year old grand daughter. On the plus side, the image is bright and colorful, and the puzzle is simple enough for a toddler to work. Considering that the puzzle is made in China and probably cost next to nothing to produce, they could have spent a few minutes finishing the edges of the pieces and lacquering the image so that it is more durable."
2,"Melissa and Doug Playful Pets Jigsaw puzzle 12 pieces: Puzzle is big and colorful and interesting to look at. Purchased it for when my 2 year old grandson comes to visit. He loves it! I already purchased another puzzle with a different pic. he loved this so much. I recommend purchasing these puzzles they are fun for little hands and sturdy too."
1,"Wood chips off: The pieces of this puzzle are definitely no for kids..or even adults.Its made of poor quality wood and easily chips off.It chips off into such small pieces that can easily embed in anyone skin or even be eaten out of curiosity.Did not expect it from a M@D toy"
1,"This product should be recalled: Please don't give this to your children.It is a nice puzzle with fun colors and pictures at first sight. But it was made of layered wood, and the edges of each piece are full of splinters. I got two splinters into my fingers by just taking the pieces apart (not to mention how tight it is). I can not imagine how the little ones play with it. It will absolutely hurt their soft hands.Sorry to give this negative review. The design of this product is good, but two things have to be done to make it acceptable: 1. polishing the edge; 2.making it less tighter."
2,"Very pretty and good quality: My two year absolutely loves puzzles and this has been a great addition to our collection.. It's sturdy and I don't think she'll be able to wear it out or break it."
2,"Fun Jigsaw!: I was troubled over what to get my son for Christmas this year but when I came across this jigsaw I knew my search had come to an end. This jigsaw will help him cope with the stresses of being a modern day 4 year old surrounded by electronic stimuli 24-7. You can't go wrong with Melissa & Doug!"
1,"Not recommanded: After reading the other review I baught this puzzle for my son. I have had this puzzle for about a week now, and prob. going to have to toss it. As if with the tightness mentioned in the other review isnt already frustrationg enough, The puzzle pieces are made with layerd wood and taking the puzzle apart made the peices crack&chip and now have little wood peices all over the floor, and some pictures started to peel off. With all this going on I dont think it is save now with the sharp corners and most likely splinters coming soon and if your child is still randomly putting stuff in his mouth still, then he might choke or cut himself. Short to say dont buy, waste of money and time."
2,"Jigsaw Fun from Amazon: I gave this puzzle to my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter for Easter. She had been doing 12 piece puzzles which ""slide"" together. This was a little more of a challenge since the pieces are ""jigsaw"", but she was able to do it. The edges are a little ""rough"", but our older ones may be smoother from many years of use."

2,"Excellent: The book gives a thorough discussion on the PRACTICAL implementation of the Transactional Ananlysis ""I am OK, You are OK"" theory.It is therefore a must read if you are into Transaction Analysis or you just want to imporve your leadership skill.Please remember to come back to give this review a vote after you have purchased the book and have read it form cover to cover.P."
1,"This is high density module: This is high density module. It works only with a fewmainboards. It does not with the two I have.Amazon.com - please correct me if I am wrong."
1,"memory problems: This Kingston memory isn't recognized by my computer which is only about a year and a half old. I went and used SimpleTech memory instead which works just fine. I would not recommend this product."
1,"Use caution with your computer: The description doesn't address the compatabilty issue with your computer. In my case, I purchased two, and had to return them both, since neither was recognized by my computer. Although the seller took them back for full credit, it's still a hassle, and a disappointment that it didn't do what was hoped it would. The rating doesn't necessarly rate the product, since it couldn't be rated because it was not compatable, it's more towards the lack of documentation regarding compatability."
1,"Didn't Work: Despite being a PC133 slot, this chip didn't work with my computer... when I put it in, the computer wouldn't boot, when removed, it booted fine... Other RAM works fine... I've used many Kingston products and this is the first time I had any problems..."
2,"Excellent buy and compatibility: I needed to upgrade from 128 MB to 512 MB. The memory got to my home through UPS (plus a dog bone for my dog) within about 5 days. Installed easily once I figured out where HP had the memory on the motherboard (behind the drive chassis!). Everything is working like a champ. Excellent buy and compatibility for an upgrade."
1,"Doesn't work in anything I put it in.: I have nothing good to say about Kingston memory. I tried installing this module in an E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system that is only 3 months old and no go. Wouldn't work in two other systems I tried. The same spec memory from Centon and PNY both worked without any problems. Mine is going back."
1,"Unhelpful and rude tech support: I found that this module wouldn't work in my computer,though industry-standard low density memory workedfine. Kingston technical support confirmed that thiswas high density memory and would not work in my PC.When I asked them to swap it for standard memory, theresponse was that I bought the wrong memory, and itwasn't their problem to exchange it to make it work.I'll not buy Kingston products again."
2,"Over 1,000 models referenced: This book really takes me back to my childhood. Seeing the prices, my only wish is that I had kept some of these pristine in the box rather than building, trading and ultimately losing track of them.The emphasis here is on figure, theme and specialty modles rather than the standard cars and military models. Covering the '50's-'70's; Sci-Fi, horror, movie, TV and hot rods are the popular subjects here.For each model there is a color photo of the box and sometimes a built model, manufacturer, date, scale and estimated value boxed or built. There is also a brief history of model manufacturing.There are nearly 1000 models here including my favorites, those wacky cars of George Barris and Ed Roth. This is a great guide for the serious collector or someone who just wants to reminisce about those hours of model building fun."
2,"How does Hilton do it? Magic? I can't figure out why his books are so moving.: Not Hilton's best, but still somehow a gem.An aimless Englishman poses as a peasant in Revolutionary Russia, & subsequently tries to wander his way back to Western Europe, discovering on the way something more important: a reason to live--but too late?Despite these problems:1) the plot, as the travelers, wander terribly,2) the supporting characters are usually either stock or flat,3) the 'suspense' usually fails, as event turns are often predictable,4) slow start; unsatisfying ending.the story still somehow works, and works well!I just don't get it. Hilton violates cardinal rules of a good novel and still somehow turns out a work that wrenches my frozen heart.Must be something in the manner of the telling.If you like this story, you'll love Hilton'sRandom Harvest, or his more famousLost Horizon: A Novel(BTW, in both cases, avoid the movies --terrible, terrible flops!)"
1,"Save Your Money!: As an incurable Beatle-maniac, I looked forward to hearing some of the cuts on this cd. BIG disappointment!! All of the songs are remakes of the original versions, and bad ones at that! None of the original Peter & Gordon or Billy J Kramer versions here. To make matters worse, the remakes are not even faithful to the originals, in some cases not even sticking to the original melody as written, but going off on interpretive ""tangents""!! Example: I hardly recognized ""Bad To Me"" as done here. Save your money, it's not even worth the curiosity value."
1,"Don't bother: A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money."
1,"AWFUL!: Fazzari massacres these compositions. He can't sing. Plain and simple. The band should be ashamed of themselves. Listen to the samples. They'll make you angry. Total garbage."
1,"Don't!: It would have been more honest if these players had just presented this disc as their own interpretations of these fine songs. These songs do NOT sound as though the Beatles were doing them. Any creditable musicians with genuine love for the early Beatles sound and atmosphere could have done a better job recreating these numbers, if that was the desire. For a good comparison, listen to ""That Means A Lot"" done by Billy Sullivan (not half so well known as Vinny Fazzari), on his ""All American Popster"" album -- exquisite!"
1,"IT STINKS ON ICE.: Wavery-voiced pop icon Madonna and incomprehensible non-singer Banderas absolutely destroy this wonderful score. The orchestrations are hideous. Pass this one by, and get the Broadway version (a masterpiece) with LuPone(BRILLIANT!) and Patinkin."
2,"GIVE THE GIRL HER PROPS: I KNOW ALOT OF YOU HATE MADONNA JUST BECAUSE SHE IS MADONNA. I HAVE BEEN A LIFE LONG FAN AND EVEN I WAS KINDA IFEY ABOUT HER DOING THIS BUT THIS IS A LADY MADE OF SHEER DETERMINATION TO DO THINGS RIGHT. SHE WORKED LIKE A MAD WOMEN TO GET HER VOICE IN CHECK AND SHE DID A GREAT JOB. SHE HAS NEVER SOUNDED BETTER. SHE HITS NOTES ON THIS SOUNDTRACK THAT I NEVER COULD IMAGINE HER DOING. NO SHE ISNT BROADWAY TRAINED LIKE THE ORIGINAL STAGE VETS BUT SHE DOES A FANTASTIC JOB. I LUV THE ORIGINAL ASWELL BUT SHE DOES ADD A CERTAIN EMOTION THAT WAS MISSING FROM PATTI AND JULIES PERFORMANCES. SHE EVEN WAS TRAINED BY PATTI LUPONES VOICE TEACHER. SO YOU HATERS JUST OPEN YOUR MINDS A LITTLE AND GET PASS THE POP ICON THING. THE GIRL DOES HAVE TALENT."
1,"The poorest of all the versions to date.: I borrowed a friend's copy and listened to this version. Madonna has a beautiful voice but it is too light for this role. Antonio Banderas is woefully inadequate in the singing department. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this recording. Buy the original Broadway cast C.D. with Patti LuPone and Mandy Patinkin. It is by far the best version."
2,"Stuck in my head forever...thanks a lot!: I'm not any sort of expert of musicals but all I know is I really enjoyed this when it came out and years later I still find myself whistling Evita songs every other day. It is memorable music and this movie/soundtrack is done in a very entertaining way regardless of how faithful it is to the original. The story itself is good but ultimately doesn't really interest me and I'm not a fan of Madonna or Antonio Whats-his-name, and Latin American politics isn't the most fascinating setting for a story, but dammit...this is just a good soundtrack and rarely is a story ever told so well with such a diverse array of music. Plus unlike many soundtracks that skip songs this one is literally THE sound track to the musical. I pushed play on the CD once while the DVD was playing and it was synchronized."
2,"You must get this soundtrack: There are two soundtracks for this movie, get this one. Yes, it is a bit more expensive, but if you want to get the full expierience of an incredible soundtrack with even more incredible talent performing it, then this is an absoute must!"
2,"I surprisingly enjoyed it: I normally don't like this kind of music but I really enjoyed ""Evita!"" It was surprisingly good for me and it will be ""surprisingly good for you."""
2,"This album has everything a person could want in a cd!!!!!: This album has everything a person could want in a cd: beautiful singing,a great music score, and (since there was no dialog in the movie) a sense of story. Antonio Banderas is a great singer. His spanish accent makes him perfect for the part. And as for Madonna, how could anyone compare her with Patti LuPone. Madonna obviously has much more delicacy and a much sweeter voice than the Broadway Evita. If it were up to me I would give this cd 500 stars. This is my favorite cd and that is saying alot since I have over 800."
1,"Lush but flawed: There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the ""edge"" and message.I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio."
2,"Evita soundtrack: I was impressed with speed of delivery, condition of product & quality of packaging for the product.The soundtrack itself is wonderful as I saw the original movie when it came out and feel Madonna & Antonio deserved a better review than they got for their performances."
1,"Buy another version. Any other version.: Who told Antonio Banderas he could sing? He can't. Madonna can but could only sing this score, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's good ones (and they are becoming rare items), if Hollywood had it lowered for her. This does spoil the balance of the musical, but Hollywood doesn't care about things like that. They also gave her a song belonging to another character which makes no dramatic sense whatsoever. Hollywood doesn't care about things like that, either.There are many recordings of the stage musical available. Buy one of those instead."
1,"The worst EVITA ever: The motion picture soundtrack, yet alone the motion picture of EVITA, is terrible. Hollywood, as usual, took a wondeful piece of work (the hit musical EVITA) and butchered it to be their way. Patti LuPone is a far better Eva than Madonna, and at least you can understand Mandy Patinkin, unlike Antonio Banderos. Also, Hollywood turned the orchestrations into modern rock 'n' roll junk, when the 1979 Premiere American Recording is the way EVITA should be. So don't waste your money on the movie sountrack, and buy the Premiere American Recording instead"
1,"HORRIBLE: This cd is horrible Madonnas verson of Eva is terrible she should not have been allowed to screw up such wonderful songs as ""Dont Cry"" and other...i dont suggest this cd to anyone who wants to hear how the songs are suppose to be sung...if you wanna hear them the right way get Elaine Paige's version or Patti LuPone...(forgive me if i spelled her name wrong)......"
2,"Just Marvelous: Wow, Madonna did such a wonderful job with this. I haven't heard any of the other recordings, but Madonna had real EMOTION in her voice. I have the single-cd copy, and I'm thinking about going and buying the double one, just because it's that good. I definitely reccommend this if you're into musicals. Even if you aren't a Madonna fan, it's worth it."
2,"Magnificent!: This cd is absolutely wonderful! Madonna is the best Evita out there! Compared to Patti LuPone and Julie Covington she is the only one who can actually sing! Unlike Mandy Patinki, Antonio Banderas brings emotion and power to his singing. His voice is strong but can also be soft when it should be. After listening to this cd, I am glad they did cut out certain lyrics and replaced them. Some of the lyrics from the old Evitas are too direct. Jonathan Pryce may not be the best singer on this cd, but at least his voice doesn't make you cover your ears every time he comes on. He fits the part very well if you knew anything about the real Evita and Juan Peron. Jimmy Nail is also a good singer, although unfortunately he is only in 3 tracks. This cd is absolutely gggrrreeeaaattt!!!! They tried and they were more than 100% succesful!!!"
1,"Blue Color: I didn't like installing this printer at all. It was recommended above the Lexmark I use at work and was looking to buy, by the sales person and I should have gone with the Lexmark. The first time it didn't install and when I tried to remedy the problem, following the directions exactly, it crashed my entire system. It took me 3 days and a lot of time with the tech to correct the problem and I am still having errors. Maybe it's because I run Windows ME but this printer has been a complete disaster. I also don't like the color quality. It reads color much darker than what's on the screen and everything has a very blue tint. I will be replacing this printer as soon as I can with a Lexmark."
1,"Have not received my item in a month.: My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month."
2,"Good Buy: This printer has not caused my any troubles to this date. It's a quality little printer, as all HP products tend to be. The quality is good, but not great. This is an ideal printer for the casual user at home or office. The connection is USB, so the setup was easy. This printer also works well on my home network. If you need a good quality printer at a good price, the deskjet 825c would be an excellent choice."
1,"Magenta: This thing is awful. Prints magenta only. Drives me crazy. I am going to go find a high building to throw it from."
1,"Constant paper jams: I had no expectations for print quality with a printer at this price, but expected something that worked. EVERY attempt to print either jammed the printer or ripped the paper. I attempted to print with newly opened reams ranging from low end generic copy paper to Epson photo paper with consistent results. If you do decide to buy, 1) ensure the store will accept returns, and 2) be prepared to pay return shipping."
1,"limitations of color printing: This printer works great for almost any application, but do not expect to print on special paper. On even the soft gloss paper, the ink blobs and gives poor quality printing. The color photos print better on regular paper than on photo or special finish paper. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR PHOTO PRINTING, you will be disappointed."
2,"This is so useful: I have had my handbook for a few years and this book has helped me with a bunch of papers for college."
2,"Definitely Brief: I do like the book and use it alot for school. The part that I use most is the Directory of Words Cited. Unfortunately, many times the exact type of work to be cited is not listed. For instance, a book with an editor in multiple volumes in an edition other than the first is not covered. Neither is an article from a journal obtained from a database."
1,"Not pleased with Express delivery!: My review is not about the book. This is one of my textbooks I needed for my course and I was glad that Amazon had it in stock. However I chose to pay highest shiping amount to express delivery for next day, (which happens to be Saturday) so that I have time to review chapter before school started, it did not arrive that Saturday. What is purpose was next day delivery if you don't receive the product on time? I think I paid about $25 for one book when there was an option to receive Monday delivery for much less ($10, I think). The book arrived on Monday after my school started and I did not have a book to take to school. Amazon owes me money!"
1,"The same bootleg nonsence: First of all, let me say that I am a huge Wes fan! Not only is he one of my favorite guitarists, but one of my favorite composers as well. Everything Wes played was genius, including all the music on this CD. However, this release is not worth buying.This CD follows in the long tradition of Wes bootlegs of the March 27, 1965 concert in Paris. The songs are mistitled, the sound quality is poor; the personal are not listed, the date is not listed, the venue is not listed, and the booklet is non-informative. To make matters worse the song order has been rearranged to an awful order!If you are interested in obtaining a good version of this concert buy ""Quintessential Wes"" by Varese Records."
1,"Terrible: It came eith a hole, so from day 1 i couln't use it without a patch, and i had to buy another patch because this one didn't work either"
1,"Came with a Leak: Guess I knew we were gambling when we bought this, since about half the existing reviews said it arrived with a leak. Remind me to never to go Vegas, right? It arrived, we blew it up with the built-in pump, which worked like a charm. Seemed like it was pretty comfortable... then my son took it on a sleepover, and woke up the next morning flat on the floor. Returned it to Amazon as a defective item for a full refund. Thinking I like another reviewer's idea of just buying a regular twin-size mattress, since we would usually be using it at home anyway, then maybe get one of the pump-less airbeds for the occasional road trip, since those have better reliability stats than the ones with the built-in pump. Live and learn..."
1,"Used it once before it broke: I bought this for my 9 year old to sleep on. We used it the first time and everything was fine. Pulled it out a month later and it has a slow leak somewhere that I can't find to repair. Basically a waste of $35. I guess you get what you pay for."
1,"Disappointment: I ordered this bed for a visit by my 4 year old granddaughter. We had to add air to the bed every morning. I had this experience with another brand, but hoped this one would be better. Definitely NOT worth the money."
1,"SEVERAL LEAK VERY SOON: The price is great. The bed looks good. I have ordered several over the last few years. I've only had 2 last 6 months or longer_ The most recent one I ordered had a leak so I returned it for a replacement. The replacement started to leak 32 days after receiving---2 days after the return policy. All I can say is if you need it- order 2; because it's likely 1 will start leaking pretty soon. Unless you only use it occassionally. I use mine every day."
2,"A great buy!: I love this air mattress! Very easy to set up and put away and very comfy to sleep on. I have slept on other air mattresses before and this is by far the best one I have ever slept on. The soft top makes it so you don't feel like you're sticking to it, but I put a blanket over it anyway for extra comfort. I have been recommending this one to all of my friends, I'm very happy with it!"
1,"Doesn't hold air: I bought this air mattress to use while my new bed was being shipped from back east, the bed lost air every night and I woke up almost on the floor. I tried to send it back but it was impossible to get back into the box."
1,"If you buy this, good luck.: We purchased the Intex Inflatable twin bed with built in pump. After a few uses it started leaking air. By the middle of the night, it was down to about half full. So, being we are out of the 30 day return time frame, we are just out.If you buy this, good luck."
1,"Horrible product: Using this air bed was a nightmare to my husband. It is not firm and loses air easily. It lost half of the air in 30 minutes. When my husband got up from this bed in the morning, he was almost on the floor. He slept as a curve during the night, which really hurt his waist, which affect his movement. Definitely will return to Amazon today."
1,"Did not hold air. I have to return it!: This looked like a good produce and inflated easily, but would not hold the air. I am very upset that in returning, I will not get full refund for this defective product! There will be a restocking charge, which is rediculous because they can't sell a defective product!"
1,"Utter Garbage: Dear potential sucker,My first airbed by intex sprung a leak in about a week, so I obtained a refund. I bought this model next, and it lasted almost twice as long!I am now on my third. I should have learned my lesson, but my current intex airbed has been around for about one year, and currently has 9, count 'em, NINE leaks. Everytime I patch one, another springs.Intex also makes inflateable boats. They must get sued for a lot of drownings. No wonder they have no email contact. If you buy ANY intex airbed, you are buying utter garbage.Sincerely,SidWa State"
1,"This is a horrible bed: I bought this bed at the end of May so that I would have an air mattress available if a guest were to stay. I first took it out of the box it was shipped in more than a month after it arrived and set it up the day before my guest was to arrive. It sat in an unoccupied room for one night- no one slept on it at all and lost substantial amounts of air. A serious amount air leaked out- it was visibly noticeable. I cannot imagine how much air would have leaked had a person slept on it. This is a horrible product. It was past the 30 day refund from Amazon and after being on hold for over 20 minutes waiting to speak to an Intex rep, I gave up. You are seriously throwing your money away if you purchase this item. It was never slept on- period- and is unusable."
1,"Seams Came Apart After 5th Use: I bought this to sleep on while I moved it to my new place and used it about 6 times before the seams on top came apart. I never realized how important the seams were until that dreary night when at 3am they started to come apart. I turned to my side and another came apart. I turned to my other side and the rest came apart (I weigh 120 lbs if it matters)which turned the bed into one giant ball. Since the seams are gone there is no shape and if you lay on it the air is distributed to the opposite of your weight...I ended up in a hammock type pose. I let some air out in hopes it would bring the top down but nope, instead I sunk further.I called the manufacturer, emailed Amazon for the contact info to be sure, emailed the manufacturer again and finally got a response. Although some models come with a 90 day warranty, this one did not so I was SOL.Never again. Buy yourself a cheap mattress instead, at least it won't break and the comfort will be about the same."
1,"Disposable item; will not last past 6 months.: So I've had this product since July 2011, and it is now in the trash. The seams do not hold up and 2 have released, creating giant 'bubbles' in the mattress rendering it unusable. I paid nearly $50 for this back then, and only used it 3 or 4 times. Very disappointed in the poor quality of this item."
1,"All of mine have not lasted long.: A comfortable bed for the money. But I've had 7 or 8 of these, and they ALWAYS fail in one of two ways:1) An external seam will break, usually near the head area. To fix it, use a good size piece of Gorilla Tape (forget the enclosed repair kit) and press down very hard around the leak so no air can get out. No need to deflate or remove flock from the area, but you have to press down carefully and firmly.2) An internal seam will pop (usually in the middle) and create a huge bubble in the center. No way to fix that, unless you want to use pillows or folded blankets to level out the low areas.That's my advice. I'm still looking for a good, sturdy alternate model."
1,"Would not inflate RETURNED: I've bought several air beds from various manufacturers. I bought one identical to this one 1 1/2 years ago. It was comfortable but lost air after 3 months. I justified this as the user may have not taken care. However, I now believe its the brand. This one would not inflate at all. I will not buy this brand again. I've had great life from a better brands."
1,"Terrible beds: I ordered these beds because my grandkids were sleeping on the floor and couldnt afford real beds and in less than 2 months both beds have popped. They didnt jump on them they just lost air seemed like the seams were the problem. 1 bed was replaced but the other remains not replaced. I would never buy these type of beds ever again or this brand. They were not cheap and I cant afford to replace them again. So now they are back to sleeping on the floor again. I heard they were good or I would not have ordered them. I am terribly disappointed."
1,"Will not completely deflate: I ordered 3 of these. They are sturdy, comfortable, and stay inflated. The electric motor in each easily and quickly inflates and (almost) deflates them. The height also makes them feel more like a real bed.However, if you want to completely deflate them for storage, that can be a real trick. I could never deflate any of them completely, so in frustration I cut one open to see what the problem is. A design flaw allows an internal plastic flap to cover the deflation port when they are almost empty. The more you try to vacuum or squeeze out air, the tighter the flap seals the port, sealing in the last bit of air.Now I know, and there's nothing I can do about it, but I feel better after attacking one with scissors..."
1,"Waste of Money: I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps."
2,"convenient twin airbed: First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed."
1,"It could be better: Currently, there are no wholes throughout the bed. But, for some reason when I wake up. The bed is already out of air. I only weigh 120lbs. I don't understand why it does that. Please save your money, when you start to have the same problem."
1,"One Was Good, So I Bought Another-Big Mistake: I purchased the first airbed and found it to be exactly what I wanted. I ordered and received a second one which I have not yet used. Meanwhile, the first one has sprung a leak and is not usable. Big disappointment. No reason for leakage as it has been used only for small individuals."
2,"Well made and great value!: We had guests that used it last weekend. They said it felt like a real bed. I was so suprised on how quickly it inflated and deflated. The cord hides away in a handy compartment. It keeps its air pressure. No need to carry around a separate pump. Our dog wanted to adopt it as her own bed. The dog jumped on it and tested it toughness. It passed with flying colors."
2,"Outstanding Bed: I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!"
1,"Worst airbed ever - Don't buy: If I could give a 0 star I would.So I bought this airbed while I had a friend visiting so she could use my bed. It seemed to work just fine the first night. However the second time I inflated this bed and slept on it, I got the worst night of sleep ever. During the night, the air slowly came out of the bed (I have checked all over for leaks or holes but could not find anything). I woke up several times to a half inflated bed and then had to re-inflate the bed again only to wake up an hour later to the same condition. Needless to say, I am extremely unhappy with the product. Hope Amazon will let me return this terrible thing."
2,"inflatable airbed: very happy with this electric pump inflatable airbed - understandable directions -very easy to inflate with electric pump - confortable to lie on especially withheadrest - easy to store with its own bag - I'm entirely satisfied with thisproduct from Amazon"
1,"RETURNED IT!: We purchased this bed for an extra for when the kids come over. Nice looking, but don't let looks deceive you. By the morning, you won't have any air in your bed."
1,"Lasted a month: It actually lasted a whole month until it decided to deflate and go flat. I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed, perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only."
2,"Easy to setup and comfortable: I got this for guests to use in our small spare room. Inflating it was quick and easy since it has a built-in pump: you plug it in, turn it on and switch off when it's inflated enough for you. The only drawback is that the pump is really noisy - about the same as a loud vacuum cleaner - so you probably want to inflate the mattress before the rest of the household goes to bed.I had one guest a week, two weeks in a row, sleeping on it for several nights. Both found it comfortable and slept well on it. The extra height makes it feel more like a regular bed and less like you're camping out on someone's floor.Like all air mattresses, the air sucks heat from the body so the sleeper can get really cold; I've found the best way around this is to place a blanket or comforter on the mattress before you put the sheets on - this bottom blanket will insulate the person from the cold air.So far it's been great and I have no complaints."
2,"I love this bed! carry it anywhere!: I was little apprehensive before buying an airbed thinking how it would be. But this turned out real nice one. It doesn't need you to call U-haul when you move out. It doesn't require much space to carry it with you anywhere you go. Its also really easy to inflate with the electronic pump and even easier to deflate naturally. After you get used to the ""airbed"", it feels like a normal bed. It offers a great option for people who don't want a hassle of carrying mattress and other accessories along with the trouble of carrying them.It also doesn't require you to carry your pillow. The top surface is velvet like thing that is so soft, you could do w/o a bed sheet also.go for it, if you need one."
1,"Huge disappointment: I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."
1,"Impossible to keep sheets and mattress pads on.: Everyone who slept on this mattress, ended up with a jumble of bedding after a few tosses and turns. I would not recommend it."
1,"I couldn't find the leaks.: When it started leaking I couldn't find the leaks. First the top started leaking, later the bottom so now I have totally given up on it.It was comfortable before it started leaking."
2,"Nice: I have not completely set this item up yet, but thus far looks like a great mattress for extra sleeping accommodations. Is for my college-age son via family visits...."
2,"Thank you for saving my back!!!: I ordered this air mattress because I have a bad back and was getting another procedure done and needed a place to recover. We already have a Queen-size air mattress but have space limitations so this was a perfect fit in more ways than one. As always, the customer service with Amazon was wonderful and they got it to me in time, and now I sleep on this air mattress more than my real bed! It is comfortable and actually helps when my back is acting up and it is the only place that I am able to find relief. So thank you for a great product, and I highly recommend it to anyone. The air stays in and it is easy to inflate and deflate. The price is also great as well. I can think of many reasons why this would be a purchase that is more than worth it for people of all ages (I am in my forties)."
1,"Comfortable, but leaked the first night: it inflated easily and was very firm, by the morning i noticed it was considerably softer, and as i sit here now typing this i find myself gradually getting closer to the floor. easy enough to reinflate, but still, this should not happen the first night."
2,"Great buy!: This bed worked great for when I had company over. I needed something that was easy and compact so I can store it when it's not needed. I like having the pump built in because there's no chasing the thing around when you need to use the bed again."
1,"Didn't Last: I bought this for my 8 year old to sleep on in temporary housing during a corporate move. This bed didn't last two days and it came apart in the seam where we couldn't patch it. I would not waste my money on this product again."
2,"Perfect for grandchildren: We always have lots of grandchildren around and they are getting older so this bed comes in handy. Because it is raised up it is easier for me to put sheets on. So glad I tried it."
2,"Guests love it.: Inflates fast. Nice shape when inflated stores well. Guest are getting a good nights rest. Would reorder if we need more."
2,"Comfortable: Is comfortable to sleep on,it fills up fast and easy. Only thing really don't like is the rubber smell it has when u first open it but little by little it goes away. I recommend it 100%."
2,"quality: I liked this, my guests said it was comfortable. It stayed inflated for the 7 days of guests and no one complained about it."
2,"Good buy: I've had this for 3 months now and it gets used about once a week and so far has held up well. So easy to use and takes no time at all. I would recommend this product."
1,"Not Happy: I used the bed 3 nights and it started leaking on the fouth night. I contacted the seller and was told to find the leak. If it was in a seam it was under warranty. I tried to find the leak, but was unable. I emailed them back to ask the best way to find the leak. I received NO response.I did a little reasearch on the web and found MANY people had a problem with this bed.So I am unable to find the leak and unable to use the bed.I an not Happy with the company I purchased if from and will not recommend them to anyone!"
2,"Not all air beds are created equal: I purchased the Intex airbed to replace an Aerobed that our cats ""loved"" too much during a guest visit. Comfort wise, the Intex wins hands down-supportive yet comfortable as well. Convenience wise, it inflates a little slower than our old Aerobed (albeit, there is more to inflate) yet it takes up less room when rolled and stored in the sack that comes with it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it is VERY high, so a restless sleeper can fall off pretty easily."
2,"air mattress: So far so good....holds the air and prefect for a sleep over at aunties's house!Easy set up,built in pupmp, easy put away....nice carrying bag also.So far worth the money, Thank you."
2,"Great Airbed: I looked at several airbeds before buying this one. I looked at several name brands, I was not familiar with Intex so I checked the reviews and am glad I did. Fast delivery, easy set up (a must for me) and a very sturdy product. We are completely satisfied with this bed. The built in pump is easy to use and works perfectly. We bought the twin due to space but intend to buy a larger bed to have on hand."
1,"huge LUMP after a few uses...: i only used this bed about a dozen times. it was never really all that comfortable and the last time i inflated it, a huge lump developed right in the middle making it unusable. there is no way to get rid of the lump and it is rock hard solid. it raised up about 3 inches high and is about 15 inches in diameter. its too late to send it back now so its going in the dumpster. i have since read other reviews of intex doing the same thing. i will NEVER get another intex again...i am going back to aerobeds!"
2,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I looked around before buying an airbed. Saw many options and compare. Many different comments that confused me. But decided to buy this one due to the price and the electric pump. Excellente product, inflates in just 2-3 minutes and last all night long. Easy to store in the morning. 5 star product."
2,"Fast, Easy, Comfortable, Great for Guest: Fast Blow-up, Easy to handle, Comfortable, Not too big & not too small - great for Guests. Only 4 out of 5 because it looses about 15% of the air originally put in within 2 days. I still recommend this product to anybody!"
2,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: The Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump is a amazing purchase comparing price and quality."
1,"sucks: leaks after leaks after leaks. i have patched them with super glue and bike patches and they just dont seem to stop comming. i am tired of patching them. dont ever buy a air mattress. just fork out the cash for a good mattress."
1,"air bed: Great product for my visiting 3 1/2 year old grand daughter! Stays inflated well.Fair price! Easy to inflate and deflate!"
1,"on website it says twin but actual size is single.: i dont know why these guys are trying to cheat. i paid full amount and i was expected to receive a twin size airbed but when i opened it it is actual size is single sized matress! so this company is baad! will never suggest it to someone."
1,"not the one I ordered: I have always recived what i ordered, but this one was not ..I ordered the hi rise, but recieved one way to short to the ground..it was to much trouble to send back, Im too old..I was dissapointed as now I can,t use it..husband can , but I can,t..be careful you get the right product..."
2,"Intex Airbed: These are only meant for use as temporary or guest bedding, but I've been in a situation where I am using this item daily as my bed for over a month now. I am a large person. It has held up beautifully. I add air maybe once every 7-10 days. The flocked top is great, holding sheets in place. It is so comfortable, my back and general body pain has improved dramatically since using it! I suspect that when my permanent bed arrives, this little bed will serve long and well as guest bedding."
2,"Great value: I have three of these mattresses. They are much longer lasting and more sturdy than other brands I have purchased. They are very comfortable.I highly recommend this product."
2,"Great Air Mattress: For the price, it can't be beat. It's very comfortable. I ordered two so I'd have one as a backup in case one sprung a leak. I had no problems with the quality of either, although it is about 6-8"" more narrow than a standard twin so twin fitted sheets are too big."
2,"Not good enough, 3 stars - got a good replacement, now 4 stars: Needs to be pumped up at least twice in the night. High rise makes it easy for older people to use.UPDATE:Amazon was outstanding. I wrote saying that the bed was leaking too much to be comfortable.. an immediate replacemnt was sent and i printed out a free shipping label online.The new bed is perfect.. three kids slept on it together and they were fast asleep when i checked later.I left the airbed out next two days and no air had leaked yet.I was lucky I think to have got a good piece.Thank you Amazon."
1,"losing air already!: We used the airbed for one guest (my very careful mother-in-law) over the holidays and it was fine. My son took it on a trip and it began loosing air the first night and he has not been able to use it since. I would not buy this again and in fact will try to return it when he returns home with it."
1,"This thing SUCKS! I went through 3 of them!!! Waste of money. Do NOT buy this: I went through three of these, neither one of them would maintain the air pressure and would slowly deflate. This occurred within 2 uses for each of the 3 mattresses i had. I considered maybe the person sleeping on it was too heavy, but alas, the person is 210 pounds and the weight limit is 300, so that wasnt it. I thought maybe it was punctured, but if it was the person would have awoken on the floor instead of on a supper jeloutnous rubber blob, so that was not it either. What conclusion left is there- this thing sucks and doesnt maintain the air."
1,"Only good for a couple of use: I bought this Intex bed for my son. He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed, although still inflates, now has a bulge in the middle, so he falls off the bed. Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same, the problem is still there."
2,"Excellent bed and for the price. Sets up quickly.: I was unsure what size to buy so I bought this twin size bed and then a queen size bed. The twin size (THIS BED) sets up quickly and FIRM! Whereas the queen size bed id more burdensome in size and labor. I recommend this twin size bed by Intex model."
1,"worthless: I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money."
1,"Not good: It only lasted for less than 3 months then there was 2 holes that I fixed but still there was a leak somewhere and eventually I just threw it away. I don't recommend this air mattress."
1,"3 weeks and heard a big boom!: Heard a huge boom and I noticed the seam had given out and then this huge bubble formed in middle of the bed and then it ripped a few days later. I purchased the product on or around 10-6-2011 and before 11-1-11 it was deflated!"
2,"So far so good....: My brother was coming to stay for a week in our apartment, so I needed something that would not be totally uncomfortable for him to sleep on 5 nights in a row. This air mattress did the job. It did a nice job of staying inflated throughout the week. My brother actually preferred the feel of it after a couple of nights (got slightly softer due to minimal air loss). The only issue I had was not being able to get 100% of the air out of it during deflation. We used the motor to remove most of the air, but towards the end it couldn't force the rest out. I tried pressure, but it seems as if the release has to be a certain angle to let the air escape. It still folded up and fit in the bag (barely). But overall, it held air and that's what we needed it to do."
2,"Perfect for me: I like itI was looking for it I found it I got and I am enjoying it to the fullestI recommend it to anyone"
2,"Comfortable, but a little smaller then some.: I like a firm bed and found that I needed to physically pump in the additional air pressure. There is that option along with the electric/fill, deflate which is very helpful. I took it camping for five nights and though I topped it off before bed every night, it didn't deflate enough for me to notice in the morning."
2,"Worth the money.: Needed place for kids to sleep while visiting grandma and now they argue over who gets to sleep on the air mattress. Both think it's more comfy than their bed at home.Would have given 5 stars, but the bag it comes with to put it in is worthless, no chance of ever getting it in there again."
1,"Terrible product, I regret spending my money on this: I bought this air mattress two months ago. I used a couple of days and it worked fine. Now a friend is planning to visit so I decided to use it again but something went wrong, instead of a flat surface, there is a huge bump in the middle that would make sleeping on it uncomfortable if not impossible.Since this is a product you will use only a couple of days before putting it away until you need it again, the amazon returning period will be over by the time you actually try it and find something wrong with it. And the company that makes this mattress says ""this product does not have any warranty or service program"". I hope I can put this in the recyclables bin!I wish I would've spend a little bit money on a real mattress that won`t fail after a while."
2,"Great convience for the price!!!!: Product arrived on time, (a little early actually---which is a good thing, :-); intact, & in excellent condition. This bed includes an ""in mattress inflation motorized pump"" that makes for ease of use, and much quieter inflation application in comparison to external pump air mattresses. It is comfortable, and an extremely good value for the price!!! Will purchase this product again!!!"
2,"item mislabeled: This is a good product. I use it nightly.It is 36"" in width, not 40"" as marked onthe box. This makes it tend to roll moreeasily. I had to frame and tie it to makeit stable."
1,"A total dud: Opened the box, unrolled the mattress, plugged in the motor and then... the motor made a few feeble noises and shut off in less than three seconds. Plugged it into several different outlets with the same results.Intex customer service told me that there are NO WARRANTIES on their air mattresses and the only option was to return it to Amazon for a refund. I will not be ordering any products from Intex in the future."
2,"okay for the price: I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine. Anyways, I recommend it to people who are looking for a temporary place to sleep."
1,"Faulty advertising: At 80"" iong, this is an extra long twin, not a standard twin. Consequently I had to take back the sheets I bought, as they were 5"" too short. I would have ordered a different model had I known that 80"" wasn't standard. It's easier just to replace the sheets and I don't have time to send the bed back."
1,"Angry: I bought this bed while I decided to purchase a normal bed. I was at first excited but as the week, past the seam popped and the bed now has a bubble and un-usable. for the money you pay for an air-bed I stick with a traditional bed over and air bed. Least to say thanks the quality is poor! I do not recommend."
1,"Crappy Air bed: Airbed doesn't keep air overnight. If you try to return it you will be charged a restocking fee to restock an airbed that doesn't work so you will get no refund.....exchange it for another crappy airbed...My recommendation is....don't buy this crappy airbed!!"
1,"Night on the Floor: The bed arrived much sooner than I expected, and I inflated it for w few minutes before I took it on my retreat. Imagine my surprize at having it deflate within an hour of getting is set up in my room. I ended up sleeping on the floor that night.We'll see how the return process goes. I'm headed out to buy an air mattress locally."
1,"do you hear air?: This item loses air overnight. Must be inflated daily if not nightly. If you return this item the store won't take it back, you must ship to the maker at your expense. Or you must cut the air pump out because they don't trust you not to keep using it, like we have to trust them on their quality."
1,"Comfortable... if not for the deflation.: I received the bed, and I loved it. But after one night it almost completely deflated. I tried to find the holes but I found none, so it was kind of a waste of money."
1,"Was hopeful, but . . .: I was hopeful this mattress would work out, having read mixed reviews, but as others stated, the mattress held air for only several days before it started losing air during the night. My son would then have to turn the air pump on (during the night) in order to have be able to have a comfortable night of sleep. Generally speaking I think all air mattresses do the same thing, as I then purchased one from the local K-mart, which is also going back tomorrow for the same problem."
1,"I so wanted to love this item: Was very comfortable when I inflated it, but had deflated twice before the night was over. Boasts features like beds twice the price -- the internal 120 AC pump is handy (especially since it deflates so fast) but it is noisy,and who wants to interrupt their sleep twice a night to reinflate the bed? Not me, that's for sure. I really wish it hadn't been a leaker, I like this bed, everything about it except that."
2,"Comfortable: We took this bed camping, and it was very comfortable to sleep on. It did lose some air overnight, so we just reinflated before going to bed. Great mattress for the price!"
2,"Intex Twin Airbed: The two beds arrived quicker than I expected. They are very comfortable and blow up quickly. Getting all the air out to put it in its duffel bag took a little work but it fit. Easy to travel with when visiting friends."
2,"Nice Bed: Seems to be a nicely designed and manufactured air bed. We've used it for guests a few times, and are pleased with it."
2,"Very convenient and easy: I bought this to stay in my daughters dorm room where space is limited and it worked great. Don't need a pump its all built in. Stayed 5 nights and added air with the flick of a switch, I like it very firm. Would buy another if needed."
1,"bubble bed: This bed sucks after 1 month I was asleep on the bed when a popping noise woke me up I didn't know what it was so I went back to sleep when again a popping noise woke me up again I couldn't figure out what it was when I got up the following morning I noticed a big bubble going down one side of the bed that's when I realized it was the bed making the popping noise smh"
1,"Not as good as Aero Beds..... was disappointed: It works but the next morning it has lost some shape and isn't as comfortable as it could be. For the price and the function is okay, the twin size made it right for our allowable space - but if you will need a longer term solution it is probably better to invest in a more expensive air bed."
1,"Low cost defective product: This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice."
2,"Aerobed saves the day (and night) with comfortable sleep alternative!: I ordered the aerobed for visiting guests, and they loved it. Also, it fit nicely in my space-challenged unit. Shipping was great! Price was great! all happy campers."
1,"bed leaked on first use: I ordered for use when company came-my niece slept on this once and ended up on the floor after one night. I cannot recommend this to anyone."
1,"Doesn't Last: We received the Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump on September 10th 2008. It is for our 8 year old daughter who has joint pain due to a genetic disorder. Her doctor recommends an air bed to relieve the pressure on her joints caused by a ""traditional"" mattress. The first 2 months it worked great. She was sleeping better and woke up in less pain. The next few months we had to pump it up every other day, but she still was in less pain. Now today, April 11th 2009, just 7 months later she can't even sleep on it. Within 3 hours the bed is almost completely flat. Our daughter is now sleeping on couch cushions until we can find a new bed. Don't waste your money on this bed! Find ANY OTHER airbed, you'll be much happier."
1,"Leaked striaght frpm the box: I chose this twin air mattres becaue of the reviews and brand, good quality. I bought it about 2 months ago for a weekend of Holiness, it just had a hole when i aired it up. Threw it in the trash terrible product."
2,"Intex air mattress: Used for a temporary bed when visiting relatives. Easy to set up and store. Inflates very quickly and is comfortable. I only used it three times and if it lasts a year, I'll be a happy ""camper""."
2,"Comfortable but still not perfect: I have purchased this matress 3 weeks ago. The price is pretty affordable, and it actually looks like a normal bed. At the beginning it leaked a bit, but after that (I really don't know why) it was ok. It is pretty comfortable. The built-in pump works very good and very convenient in use. The only two things are that I don't like in this matress are that one side of this matress is higher by 2-3 mm than another. And when you sleep on it you feel like there is a small angle. I mean the matress is not 100% horizontal. Another thing that peaces me off is the noise that comes from the matress when you move or somehow turn over. But overall it is good substitution if you need a temporary bed."
2,"Intex Inflatable Twin Bed: I've only had it a little bit however many words have been written pro and con about this product so I to shall endeavor to provide you with some useful information.1st it is an airbed and it doesn't take kindly to claws of many kinds or sharp point objects. 2nd it is a portable airbed... the valve isn't a perfect seal as with any air mattress or bed so expect to use the built in pump every now and then as a result of seepage .. 3rd comfort just pump it up or deflate to personal comfort level. 4th the price is relatively low cost. 5th Seems to be of decent quality aired up right out of the box and has held the pressure with no major leaks."
1,"Sized Incorrectly: I purchased 2 Intex Pillow Rest Twin Beds due to the size specifications of 40 X 80 X 18 1/2"". They were to be used by my >6 ft. tall family members when visiting. I was extremely disappointed when we inflated the 1st bed - which BARELY measured 32 X 70 X 16. I sent a letter to the supplier, CMS WorldWide Sales, explaining my dissatisfaction & was told to send pictures & measurements (which I did) and they would [quote]...""Once you had provided us the information we had requested, we will be glad to forward you the return shipping labels.""This was months ago, and to date I still have 2 Intex Pillow Rest Beds (the 2nd box was never even opened!) that are no where near the specs stated on the packaging.I will NEVER order anything from the CMS WorldWide Sales supplier again."
1,"decent for price, only one fall back so far: I purchased this a couple weeks ago, and used it for the first time last night. It worked well. Plugged it in and it only took a couple min to inflate. My problem with this bed is not so much how well it works inflating but what a hard time i had deflating it this morning. I was so frustrated trying to get all the air out that i finally just wrapped it up. With even a little air still in it, it makes it so hard to roll up tightly and put away. It just looks bulky. I have tried aerobeds in the past and i love that their beds have a release valve, this one uses the a small hole built in with the pump. The release valve work much better, and I decided to go with this because it was affordable and i couldn't find aerobeds in twin size. I am definitely gonna see if i can get a return on this... i just hope i can fit it back in the box it came in."
1,"misgivings: The bed needs air refilling more often than I thought it would- every 3 days at the most. So much so that if I didn't pump it, the bed would all be like a water bed with ""jelly-like"" feeling. To lessen this effect I situated it in a corner of the room against the walls. Further more, what surprised me was the round water condensation on the bed sheet just underneath my (head) pillow in the morning. But what confuses me is that in the evening the bed feels cold (or the air inside feels cold).What I like about it though is that the pump works real fast in inflating- although it is loud for an evening activity."
2,"Great Bed @ Great Price...: I purchased this airbed because I wanted to sleep in the same room as my newborn. Yes, I'm one of those paranoid new moms. This bed goes above and beyond. I wanted to buy the AeroBed first because I'm one of those people who hates to buy cheaper items because they usually break or whatever. I'm pretty much a sucker for the theory that expensive = quality. However, I went with my gut and decided to try this airbed having never heard of the company before. Listen to your gut! It inflates in 3 minutes and deflates in about 3 minutes. If you want it to be more firm & allow the air to settle in better, you should leave it in there for about 7-10min. Not a big deal at all. Go do something in another room while you're inflating it. This thing can also handle a lot of weight. When I'm sleeping on the airbed, my husband comes in the room to tell me he wants to sleep in this bed too because it's so comfy. Great Buy!"
1,"not 80in in length: I ordered it because I have a 6ft 8in relative who spends time with me. The description says this airbed is 40in wide and 80 inches in length. The box housing the bed clearly states the bed is 39 in wide and 75 inches long. I am really disappointed because I have been shopping for this for over 3 months and only recently decided this was the right bed. WRONG!The goal is to provide comfort. /his won't, his feet will be hanging off the edge of the bed. Its going back."
1,"Went flat in the middle of the first night.: This airbed does not stay inflated. It went flat half way through each of the five nights I used it. It is junk. Don't buy it. If I had bought it at a store it would have gone back the next day."
2,"A little hard to fold back up but seems great otherwise: I'm arranging a getaway weekend in hotel, so I bought a bunch of these. I tried one first and it seemed nice and working as specified. The only thing is that it's tough folding and putting it back into it's bag."
1,"Garbage: Only used a handful of times and the bed already leaks air. Waste of money. I know it shows a one star rating but the true rating is zero stars."
2,"Awesome Air Bed: This is used for when my older son has friends stay over night. It's easy to set up, and comfortable. Does the job flawlessly."
2,"Great: This really worked out well for me! It lost a little air but that is to be expected. I use this during the holidays when extra people are visiting."
2,"It must be good...: I tried it out and fell asleep on it. No noticeable leakage overnight. It seems to me like a good buy."
1,"One Strike: The product deflated during the night. We refilled and let sit with no one in it for a while and it still lost air. I was very disappointed as the product initially started great for my Aunt who would not have been able to be on the floor with a traditional air mattress. I am attempting an exchange hoping it was just this one item. Most of the reviews were glowing and I am hoping that the replacement will perform as the other reviews indicated."
1,"No-Go,sorry: Was nice while it lasted. After a few nights on the mattress, one of the seams in the middle apparently broke. Now it's nothing but a large bubble in the center. Tried flipping it over but it's like sleeping on a rocking chair. Nothing to do but take it to the dumpster."
2,"comfortable kids bed: My grandson loved sleeping on this blow up bed, he said it was so comfortable. It's a great idea if you need xtra guest beds, because it deflates and stores so easily. It takes about 3 or 4 minutes to inflate.I would recommend this product highly."
1,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed, deflating within 3 months: I had another airbed that lasted about 2 years before there was a leak and needed to replace it. This one had pretty good reviews and it was taller when inflated and would be easier to get on and off it. I did like the airbed and it was comfortable. We used it less than 5 times over the last 4 months and it deflated slightly last time I used it. I should have investigated further at that time but just deflated it until next use. I used it this weekend and had to pump it up again in the middle of the night and I think my time for warranty is over with."
2,"Good for its value: I bought the bed with the idea of using it during one week while my father was visiting. It fulfilled its purpose perfectly. It's comfortable, it inflates and deflates very quickly and it's pretty high. There are two reasons why I am not giving it a 5-star score: a) I used sheets and still, when I woke up, my back was sweating. I guess that it is a problem with all these beds that are made of plastic, but... that is a drawback. b) I haven't been able to fold it and fit it in the bag again, it's almost impossible.Anyway, overall, it's a great deal for its price. I would absolutely recommend it and the problems I pointed out are probably a problem in all air beds."
2,"Very Comfortable: The bed is nice and soft and double thick. The auto pump is easy to use and works pretty well with new batteries. The vacuum drain does ok but when down to the base have to help it by rolling it at the end. Folding it isn't to hard and package size isn't to big so easy to store. Bed lines fit ok on it but get good one so they squeeze tight so they hang on. But for the money is a great buy I shopped around a lot target, walmart, dicks, Meijer, sears, kmart, ect. So very good buy if you want one for camping or a guest bed."
2,"Good!!: I like this product. The power code is nicely kept in the unit so I do not have to worry about losing the power code. Kids love it when their friends come for sleep over. Quick and easy to use."
1,"Wont hold air after 32 days since online purchase thru amazon: Product was defective from day on and lasted a whole 32 days and now will inflate but by the middle of the night you sleeping on the carpet."
1,"No good.: This product was received having a slow leak ..box was received damaged. .. Daughter went to bed at morning we discovered her in the middle (sinked).... I would not recommend......"
1,"Beware of the dimensions: I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box."
2,"INTEX air bed: The item arrived on time and was easy to set up. It stayed inflated the entire night and was quick to deflate the next morning. We have always been Aerobed purchasers in the past and now find this Intex to be just as good quality wise."
2,"Great: This bed is great, compact and comfortable. We've had guests who use it ask us where we got it because they want to buy it too."
2,"Intex Pillow Rest Airbed: This is the exact product we were looking for. It's compact, self filling, and pretty comfortable. It's perfect for traveling or when company spends the night. It provides the extra sleeping accommodations we needed. The 120v pump fills the bed quickly. The battery pump or foot pump wouldn't have worked well for us."
1,"It doesn't stay firm even overnight.: It doesn't stay firm even overnight. The motor burned out after a while. I bought a Coleman. . . ."
1,"Short Product Life: This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer."
1,"Terrible product and customer service: I purchased three of these and within 1-2 months, ALL three of them ""broke"". The seams on two of the beds broke, leaving a huge bulge in the middle of the bed and the seams of the third bed kept coming apart..Im not sure how many holes I had to cover but way more than their repair kit allowed for. After contacting the company and starting the refund process, I was told that since they were bought through Amazon I wouldn't be able to receive a refund. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! Yes, the beds are $35.00 so I definitely got what I paid for but can't believe how cheaply they are made. DO NOT BUY THESE PRODUCTS!!!! Spend more to get more bang for your buck!"
1,"nice sleep, but bottom seam blew: Just a great item. However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability. After two months, one seam ""disappeared, and now the bed rocks, because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it, just have to put some towels, whatever to stabilize it."
1,"slow leaking: Air mattress: Looks good, works but requires frequent running of pump. Appears to lose air through the built-in pump. Should have returned the mattress but need the bed for visitor. Probable would not buy with built-in pump in future."
1,"doesn't leak but uncomfortable to sleep on: I bought this product because I'm living temporarily in a city and will move to another city later, and don't have the extra money to buy a better bed. Since then my shoulders hurt from sleeping on it. I've lost interested in sleeping after that. Before that i never have problems with sleeping.It's ok to sleep for one or two nights only i guess. If you intend to sleep on it for a few months, buy a comfy bed instead of this!"
2,"Very satisfied!!!!!!!!: I have not seen or slept on this mattress........bought for my daughter for a quick replacment.............she tell's me she thinks it GREAT.....I bought the twin size,and she tells me when she buys a full size it will be the same one. I have an inflatable bed she has slept on while visiting, and she said this is 100% better. I might add my daughter is not someone who is easily pleased."
2,"Comfortable, but needs insulation from cold: We purchased 2 of these for guests' use and they are quite comfortable. The pumps work relatively quickly and quietly, and allow for good firmness in the mattress. They also held air well and needed little additions over 2 weeks' time.Our only drawback was that the air doesn't provide insulation from cooler ambient air. We keep our home cooler at night, and a guest found it necessary to cover the mattress with a heavy blanket to insulate properly from the coolness. I would recommend a mattress pad or foam topper when using this to provide some extra warmth."
1,"Not Durable: Had the bed two weeks and so far not a problem. I did not inflate it to the maximum pressure-I'm 250lbs the maximum load being 300lbs-but rather 3/4 full of air. I have added air only one time-maybe 10 seconds. I sleep on this airbed every night. There is a tendancy for me to roll to the side of the bed-whether that's just me or the bed is yet to be seen. To add to this review I had the bed for three months-the pump went out after that time. I suppose we take our chances.MalcolmL"
2,"This product is great.: This bed is great. I use it everyday for my little.So far its still inflated and very comfortable.Recommend it for anyone who has a guess or personal use.I especially like the pump, how its connected to the bed andcan store-it inside the bed."
1,"Cheap Not worth your money: I purchase this air mattress in late October and two month later I was laying on the mattress I move my arm and a fist size hole appear over my head. The mattress arrive fast and was easy to set up. If you plan on using this mattress for a guest bed or for your kids when they come home for the Holiday or summer break please get something else. Not worth the money. I had Coleman and small hole appear and the patch does not work but for this mattress the patch does work for a small hole not the fist size hole."
2,"Good Air Mattress: Very good air mattress, have had many friends come and stay on it and it hasn't lost much air. Would recommend it if you need an air mattress for visitors."
1,"Worst Air Bed Ever.: This mattress began leaking after only 3 or 4 nights of use. I found the leakbetween a crease in the top (flocked) side. After proper repair effort it wasunable to stay inflated. I have put the air bed to better use. Thank youKeith Colton"
2,"Nice rest: Really nice portable bed, I don't wanna back sleeping in a regular bed!!!. I highly recommend this item for everybody who is looking for a good bed to be sleeping like a baby."
2,"I would definatly buy this again: The bed was comfortable and filled easily. It's only draw back was that did not fit all the way back into the carring box."
1,"Leaked: We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box."
1,"Worst purchase ever.: This was the worst product I ever bought. It held up only about 40 days and then, got more inflated on one side then the other. Of course ended in the trash. I have no car, so was very hard for me to return the item, and go to the post office. Waste of money. Do not order from this company ever. BAD PRODUCTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Bad product: This is not worth the price. Used it once and had to re-inflate it five times. Does not hold air. A piece of junk."
1,"Not satisfied: The air mattress was good only for one day, after one day it started deflating and I have to inflate it every night before sleep. By the time I wake up on it the next day it has become like a water bed since it has deflated. I cannot find the hole from where it deflates."
2,"Good value, works as advertised: I bought this air bed to accommodate a 120 lb. guest who used it for five days. The initial fill took only a few minutes. It was really convenient. It needed only 5-10 seconds of re-inflation after 3 days to make up for lost air. Even so, we weren't sure if the bed had lost any air at all. This mattress has remained inflated for 3 weeks now without losing air as far as I can tell. I'm happy with my purchase -- it does its job."
1,"This bed will not retain air.: It was a super deal... But there is something wrong with it. It will not retain the air level that I want.I will be returning this item"
2,"Twin Airbed w/built-in electric pump: This product worked just as advertised. Inflated in less than 3 minutes, and after testing for 2 weeks, remains inflated with just minor refill of air required. Great value for the price. Highly recommended."
2,"TERRIFIC Air Mattress!: I inflated this air bed for a guest who reported how comfortable it was. The twin fitted sheet worked great and didn't slip around with the flannel surface. The installed inflation/deflation pump also worked great and was fast. My guest used the air bed for an entire week, and it never lost air or got soft. My only criticism is that the static on the rubber underside did pick up some loose dirt and dog hair that was on the hardwood floor where I placed the bed."
1,"Not available.: I don't really hate it, because my order was cancelled for some unclear reason. The order was cancelled several days after I placed it, so I'm no fan of Intex."
2,"Worth the price!: I move between places a lot and hence can't afford to buy permanent bed frames and mattresses. I wanted to buy this portable bed and use it for everyday sleep and also as a standby couch. It's been serving the purpose well so far for the couple of weeks. I've gotta wait and see if any major leaks occur in the future.Here's the reason for the missing star. It never becomes flat or very saggy, but needs air top up daily for sure. Especially since I'm using this also as a couch to sit, sometimes I need to inflate it for a couple of minutes before going to sleep to get the firmness I want. Of course it is absolutely not as comfortable as a box spring mattress on a frame, but I can assure that this is definitely worth the bucks if the need is an inexpensive temp bed for everyday use.By the way, this very same model costs $89 in Walmart when I checked, hope now it is not!"
2,"Very Comfortable - Convenient Build in pump: Used while camping for a week and was delighted by the level of comfort and the ease of inflating with the built in pump! Air loss for me was in line with the many other airbeds I have owned, and with the built in pump, made it easy to top it off every other day or so. Highly recommend this great affordable air mattress!"
1,"Leaky unit: I ordered this bed in an emergency situation for my 95 year old mother to sleep on. The bed was easy to fill and evacuate, but it has a slow leak that necessitates adding air to it every day. I couldn't send it back because I would have had nothing for my mother to sleep on."
1,"customer service is dead: every person i communicated with was not only rude but were clearly annoyed by my need for help and completely unwilling to assist me . I returned the product that i was charged $103.10 for and was refunded $40.70 . thanks"
1,"Just like all the other airbeds: I filled it with air when it arrived. It lost air by the morning. Since the bed was cold when filled, I gave it another chance. The first night is was actually used, it had to be refilled in the middle of the night."
1,"Lasted one month of everyday use: I used this product for one month of every night sleeping before it sprouted a leak in one of the seams on top that couldn't be patched due to the fabric. It makes patches virtually impossible to stay stuck.There you have it."
1,"Never buy this product it's a wast of money: HI All,Never ever buy this product you will lost money and it's a wast of time.........leacking after a week. fix that than find another leaking...till u trash it..and get rid of it..i have the pic and i paid for it $60 worth nothing zerrrrrrrrrrrrroooooooooooooooo."
2,"Extra Bed: Love it! When the boys come home and bring their friends, everyone has a bed!!! They roll up small and tight for easy storage. Also, they are very comfortable. I will even inflate one so I can enjoy sleeping by the warm fire on very cold nights."
1,"Air Mattress works great: We loved the internal pump which also will pump the air out. It is so fast and the mattress itself gives a good night's sleep."
2,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin AirBed: This bed was purchased as a spare bed for short time visitors as we are limited in space in our Park Model RV. We needed someting that didn't take up much room to store and yet was comfortable enough so that as person could get a decent nights sleep on it. After reading all the reviews I could find, I deduced that some of these beds were faulty (like all things) and that they tended to deflate overnight, but, that most were fine. Our bed has met all of our expectations and is fine, comfortable and holds the air. I would highly recommend this product!!"
2,"BEST AIR MATTRESS EVER!: This bed is awesome, perfect size, pump works great just a bit noisy like a vaccuum cleaner, ordered it on friday got monday the next week even though i used standard shipping (3-5 business days)."
2,"Great airbed!: Really great airbed, comfortable, easy to inflate, portable. Seems to deflate rather quickly but only takes 5 seconds to refill."
2,"Intex Pillow Rest Twin Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump: I received this air bed over two months ago and we love it. I bought it for my granddaughter to sleep on and it's the easiest thing to set up and take down to put away. I put a mattress pad on under the sheets and she says she would rather sleep on the air bed than her regular bed because it that comfortable. No leaks so far. I'm very happy with this purchase."
1,"Intext Pillow Rest Twin Airbe: I was so excited when I received this air bed, but after sleeping on it on the first night, things changed. Every single night I had to put more air in it in order to keep it firm. There were no leaks that I could hear, but it was a pain to keep putting air in it every night. If this does not bother you, the bed itself is extrmeley comfortable.Intex Pillow Rest Queen Airbed with Built-in Electric Pump"
2,"GREAT BED, GREAT PRICE: THIS AIR BED IS GREAT! I HAD PREVIOUSLY PAID WAY MORE FOR THE ""A--O"" BRAND, BUT THIS ONE IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE. I AM A GAL WITH A ""MATURE"" FIGURE, AND IT (TWIN) ONLY LOST A LITTLE AIR. WITH THE ELECTRIC PUMP, NO WORRIES! JUST A HINT FOR SOME OF YOU WITH BAD KNEES LIKE I HAVE....I PLACED TWO CAMP COTS SIDE BY SIDE AND LAID THE MATTRESS ON TOP. PERFECT FOR THESE TIRED OLD KNESS AND BODY TO GET UP AND OFF OF. KUDOS ON THIS AIR BED!"
1,"LEAKED FIRST DAY FOR MY GUEST: IT HAD A LEAK FROM DAY ONE. RETURN AND EXCHANGE PROCESS WAS VERY GOOD THOUGH. STILL WAITING ON THE NEW ONE"
2,"Super airbed: Ordered two and tested them out: one had a bad pump but the return was easy.These airbeds are super cheap and great. Everyone who has slept on them says they are extremely comfortable. They hold the air well. I recommend them very highly"
1,"Low Quality: Bought this product for a friend's visit back in late October. Since then (It is now early February), it has been slept on for a total of seven nights by two different normal sized adult guests, and promptly deflated when a third guest tried to sleep on it this past week. To its credit, the product did last just fine through those seven nights. It did, however, break not too long after the 90 day warranty ended and we have no reason to believe we will be able to repair it or otherwise recoup our loss. Purchase with the understanding that this is basically a disposable air bed with a warranty that seems conveniently short."
2,"blow up bed: I purchased for my guest room for overnight stays for family members.this holds up very well especially for grandchildren"
1,"not reccomended: Would not purchase this item again. Used in spare bedroom for guests. Hardly used, until now. Hoping top have Xmas guests use. First to lay on it, and center ring pooped.Still usable, but uncomfortable. The second night used bed hissing sound and a large leak appeared. They provide plastic to repair leaks, but do not provide any adhesive. I have to eat it now because I had until 11/12/12 to return.I can get partial credit, not including shipping if I just had just kept the box and shipping label for 3 months."
2,"Intex Pillow rest Twin: I ordered this for a friend who was displaced and has had to start over. He had a Airbed from a store but kept having to bring it back due to leaks and other problems. This bed looked much more comfy and with my Prime discount I sent it to him. Within the two day time frame it arrived and as soon as the other bed sprung another leak he put it to work. He says it's very comfy compared to the other so if he's happy I'm happy with the product"
2,"Good price, good night.: Decent product. I had to sleep on it for a few nights and I survived. It is comfortable enough to pass out on It stayed inflated the whole night and deflates well. It comes with a sack for storage, though my folding skills are pretty lame, so fitting it into the bag is a challenge for me."
1,"Hold on a minute: Add these ingredients:Flashy music, beautiful ladies, sexy dance moves, scanty clothes (no nudity), beautiful landscapes, and even some seaside hobbies... and what do you get?Wait a minute...Now add a film editor who thinks his amateurish effects are more important than the above ingredients. All the above scenes of the hobbies, the ladies, the landscapes were all spliced and edited into each other for a ""strobe"" effect of split second images so that you can't focus on any of it.Now what do you have?Probably a yard sale item in the 10 for a dollar bin. I may buy some of the earlier volumes to see if they're the same... wish me luck."
2,"Good kids book!: We just got this book and again it is great. Diane Layton does a great job speaking to little ones about something so very serious and making it understandable. I have loved everyone of her books that we have received. They are wonderful, I wish there were more books like these!"
2,"Just listen to Julis's letters!: I had a old LP of this recording. I got this because I had been blown off by his masterpiece, Second contribution. Just try Julia's letters. You will be surprised. Strongly recommended. BTW, did he know he looked like Jesus?"
2,"Street Index Fine Print: The street index is hard to read for the over forty crowd. If the font size was 12, it would have been much easier to read."
1,"Get Out Your Magnifying Glasses!: Although this is a good collection of Poe's short stories, the pages crisp and the typeface clear, THE TYPE ITSELF IS VERY, VERY, VERY SMALL! I am getting older, but do not need glasses yet and I can hardly read a word or two before my eyes begin to cross! I don't understand book manufacturers anymore. Either the typeface is illegible, the paper so poor that all the letters blot together, or the print is teenie tiny. Aren't books supposed to be read? Also, something strange, the chapters arent seperated. One story runs into the next without starting a new page."
1,"Nesmith goes too far: Carrying on from the mostly instrumental albums of ""The Prison"" & ""The Garden"", we get ""Rays"".Which is nowhere as strong as these albums, with Nez laying on the Synths, giving a slight Queen from the 80's feel (which nobody wants to hear).He also creates a horn section using the synths, which just sounds cheap & tacky.With ""Prison"" & ""Garden"" you hear richly textured & ambitious soundscapes, but ""Rays"" is to low-fi (which I don't have a problem with), it just doesn't work with such a complete piece of work.This is the only weak Nesmith album, so I suggest you purchase the rest of his back catalogue before arriving at this (low) point."
1,"Got ""Burnt"" By Rays: This entire album sounds like it was rather cheaply recorded via nothing but sequencing on keyboards that really don't sound that great anyway.It reminds me of those keyboards you used to buy where you could push one key and it would play a song for you.I really don't understand why he released this. I've been a Nez fan for years, but this one left me feeling quite ripped off.I feel he's taking his fans for gullible idiots with this half hearted attempt at an album; thinking we'll buy anything he puts out."
2,"good and unique music: I heard some long-time fans of Michael Nesmith were confused. You'll listen to Michael's new sound."
2,"Best Lan Case for full size mobo: Excellent case! It comes in handy once a month for lan partys due to the carrying harness. Not to mention the weight will not break your back compared to other cases.I have owned SFF (Small Form Factor) machines in the past but I have to admit nothing beats the cooling and hardware upgrade potential of the Antec Super Lanboy."
2,"One of the very best.....: This is one of the very best ""rockumentaries"" ever! I loved the whole thing, especially the interviews....especially the ones with the ultra-talented producer/singer/song writer/pianist John Simon-my friend. You might consider checking out John's own recordings."
2,"A great documentary of one of the best albums ever: Any fan of the Band's music would get a lot out of seeing this documentary, which reveaks the creative process that went into their two masterworks, ""Music From Big Pink"" and ""The Band"". Band"" the story of Music from Big Pink is also covered here. Great interviews and stories from producer/engineer Joe Simon, and band members Robbie Robertson, Levon Helm, Garth Hudson and Rick Danko as well as a fitting obit to Richard Manuel."
2,"Great documentary on a great album.: I've always like VH-1's Classic Albums series and this episode doesn't disappoint. Great interviews with Robbie, Levon, and other band members (Including Rick Danko, who died last December). I love how they broke down Rag Momma Rag and Rockin' Chair into it's separate parts. A must for all Band Fans."
2,"THE BAND: THE BROWN ALBUM: When the ""Classic"" series of videos came out, I could only wish for anything on The Band. The ""Brown Album"" or their 2nd album is highlighted here in story and song. The interviews are well worth the price of admission. The Brown Album has always surfaced as one of the top 10 favorites of many other music artists. Watching Garth Hudson at the keyboard; or Levon Helm explain his drum technique; or sitting at the recording console and listening to the harmonies with producer John Simon, is a look inside of a group that changed the sound of North American music in the late 60's to mid 70's. This was probably their best effort of them all and to have it chronicled here is great. I have both the VHS & DVD versions. Since then I purchased Live at the New Orleans JazzFest."
2,"Excellent Documentary of one of the Greatest Albums in History: This is one of those movies that I didn't want to end. It is that good. Seeing Robbie, Levon, Rick, and Garth look back at this album, and talk in depth about the making of it, was pure heaven. Seeing the joy on Levon's face when talking about Garth's playing put a smile on my face. I'm not waxing poetic here, folks. If you love the Band, do yourself a favor and get this DVD."
2,"A must for fans of The Band: This is a terrific video - especially if you are a fan of The Band.I never realized how great Richard Manual was until I saw this video."
1,"The Band: Although the recording was somewhat ineresting, due to the lack of music in the recording I find very dissapointing. I will probably play it three or four times and then dispose of it."
1,"Blah Blah Blah.......: Good God, was this boring! I couldn't even finish watching it before I tossed it. I usually enjoy reading or hearing how artists create, it fascinates me. And I love The Band that used to be. But this was boring as heck. Sorry, Robbie. Sorry, Levon."
1,"You're Kidding!: I just screened the dvd of The Band which cost $65.00! If you like 75 minutes of interviews with some musical clips (all far better in The Last Waltz--where each song is 100% seen on camera and mixed great) than send me $55.00 and I'll ship you my copy. I love The Band but this looks like a BBC TV doc.Bill"
2,"The Naturalist's Guide: This book is literally a Naturalist's guide. I can't believe there are not more 5 star ratings of this book. As an arborist, birder, and wildlife biologist born in the piedmont I recommend this book."
1,"BROKE after a short time, not truly waterproof, way too large, and smells like rubber: This item broke after a very short time of use. It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower. The next day it was dead, and water kept leaking from it. So now it's dead.It is very big, way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert. It is not flexible or pliable, so it is not adjustable to people's bodies or preferences! The bullet function actually burns, so it is not pleasant. Also when it is first opened a very very very strong rubber smell comes out, and it definitely does not go away.It's not high quality, it broke very fast."
1,"Terrible: After repeated washings, it still smelled like a toxic plastic and who wants to put toxic plastic inside their body. Also, it didn't do the job. So I wasted my money and had to throw it away."
1,"Great power, not great shape: The reviews were right about it being VERY large in girth. It was a bit uncomfortable, and I didn't love the bumps on the back (that you can't see in the picture or in the description), and the ""head"" of it has quite an edge.When you take it out of the package, it has an overwhelming smell of plastic, so it probably contains those carcinogens that everyone is talking about.The exterior piece is VERY powerful and would be great if it was on another toy. The tickler is also fairly rigid and difficult to place exactly.I wouldn't recommend it because I think you can do better. And I also think it's worth it to spend more money on a toy without phthaylenes (or however you spell it)."
1,"way too big: This product is NOT intended for a beginner...i had many toys and this one by far caught me by suprise on how big it is. The shaft is too big and makes it uncomfortable unless used with the right lubrication. Being a smaller/petite woman, it was a little uncomfortable for me b/c of the size...but other than that, it was very pleasurable."
1,"ridiculous: I find it hard to believe there are women really using this product ........turns out it's about the same diameter as the cardboard tube inside paper-towels. Seriously ???~~~"
1,"Help!: Hello everybody! I ordered this product but the first one that i received didn't work, and now i have the second one and it still doesn't work. It might sound weird, but i put batteries in it and it doesn't start working. What should i do? Thanks!"
1,"Not waterproof!: It's not water proof and it rusts on the inside. The turning head is a nice feature, but I don't think I really needed it."
2,"Easy Climax: I'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub,shower or where ever."
1,"PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE: WASTE OF MONEY. FIRST TIME BUYING SUCH AND IT NEVER WORKED. MOTOR NEVER TURNED WHEN BATTERY WAS PUT IN. SUCH BLATANT ROBBERY!"
1,"Doesnt work: First off I am currently deployed and my wifes fisrt viberator that we bought, to help with the lonely nights, was supposed to be waterproof got some water damage and no longer works. She asked me to order her another so I looked around and found this one, it had many decent reviews so I decided to order it. When it arrived and my wife opened the package only to find that the item I ordered had a much larger cirmcurference, the one she had before was about 5 inches or so. She decided to try to use it because of the fact that there is not a return policy. When she attempted to use the item it did not work, she tried replacing the batteries and that only made the rabbit portion come on. It would be extremely helpful if there were some sizes and lengths to determine what exactly you were buying. So all in all I am extremely disappointed in this product and would not recommend it to anyone."
1,"Yuck: This thing smells SO gross, like harsh, toxic chemicals, that I can't even use it! I've washed it in HOT, super soapy water, cleaned it with alcohol, and even let it ""air out,"" all to no avail. I tried using it and the smell was seriously distracting. I took it out of my drawer, after all the washing, to show it to my boyfriend and while i was still a good four feet away he said, ""Ewww, what's that smell."" I found it to be WAY too large, too, and I've had kids. Sadly, this will be going in the garbage."
1,"A Little Too Much: I thought this would be good to try because I love the floating beads in the other rabbit vibes. I am a single gal, solo practitioner so to speak, and found that the steel rotating balls are just not comfortable for me. They are too hard with no give and get quickly uncomfortable especially if you squeeze your muscles. I can usually have one orgasm with this toy but not the multiple orgasms with the more comfortable rabbit vibes with the pearl beads. It's okay but it just doesn't get the job done for me."
1,"well: i bought this for my wife to replace her rabbit habbit that broke after a few uses. let me first say that it say 1 1/2 inches no it makes the rabit habit look tiny. its hugeat least 1 3/4 inch around. but its much slower than the other dosent vibrate near as fast. other than the size being more real size she liked the rabit habit better but we just got this one maybe it will get better. just goes to show bigger isnt better always. needs more power"
1,"Painful, no pleasure, and doesn't work. Smells horrible!: First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The ""rabbit ears"" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the ""floating beads"" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though."
1,"Beware-Can't return if defective as this one is!!!!!!!: This product would not even turn on once batteries were installed! It also has a terrible chemical odor which would probably cause most health conscious people not to risk actually using it anyway!Please be aware you cannot return so order at your own risk!"
1,"Defective/No Return: When I ordered this item, I was not aware that it could not be returned if defective. The item arrived very timely, but it would not operate. I later found out that the product is nonreturnable. I was very dissatisfied with this purchase."
1,"Doesn't work: I received this item and it;s dead!Doesn't work and I cannot return it. wasted $40 bucks..I'm so angry, I bought this as a gag gift for my friend for a party and now i'm out money...Very disappointing..."
1,"doesnt work: Put new batteries in - product wont turn on at all - very disappointed !!! Save your money - many others are better - should have read the other reviews and then i would have been warned"
1,"So Disappointing!: I was so excited to try this item when I ordered it, but when I got it I was so disappointed because it didn't work. It didn't even turn on! I didn't try to return it because I was under the impression it is a nonreturnable item. I won't order this product again but will try ordering from Amazon again."
1,"No go: I did not like this one. It is a bit large and it has a plastic, rubbery smell that never goes away. It's also slightly loud. I have had similar toys before and I like this one the least."
2,"Excellent: First rabbit and it works amazingly. It does things that I never expected it to do. I would definitely by another one if something ever happened to this one."
1,"didn't even work: Out of the box it didn't even work. Whats worse there isn't an easy way to return it. I'm having to email amazon and hope for an exchange within a week.?"
2,"Okay.....: I think the rabbit part is kind of bothersome and I thought the actual shaft would vibrate not just the rabbit. WEIRD."
2,"BREATH TAKING!!!: My boyfriend bought this for me for Christmas, i have to say at first (without using it) i was a little disappointed with the rotation i thought it would be stronger after using it though i thought this thing was absolutely amazing. my boyfriend seems to be a little jealous off it but i guess you'll have that lol. Ive used it in the shower now twice and i have had no problems at all. like other people have stated it does have a new rubber smell to it but its very faint to begin with and will fade off you really cant smell it unless its right up by your face. as far as width though... wet or lubricated Ive had a hard time getting it in. there's been times where i just gave up and didn't even bother because it hurt but once its in its actually very pleasurable. deff. not a toy for people who are inexperienced that's for sure. all in all great product and especially for the price I'm very pleased. : )!!! ill probably buy more here very soon lol"
2,"To Infinity and beyond!!!: This is a good lil machine for the price :) I got it for me (especially), but my boyfriend loves to use it on me too. Those little bunny ears work Freakin wonders!!!I never climaxed so quickly.I don't really care for the rotating beads as much as the vibrating bunny ears.When you combine them..boy watch out ;) I would buy this again if I had to.This is my favorite toy so far."
1,"I didn't think it was that good.: Got this product and used it but it doesn't get me to the big O. It's just to stiff for me and also the rabbit ears don't reach the right place. All i have to say it's just wasn't for me. I wish i didn't buy it."
1,"broke one first use: First time buying a toy of this type. Great orgazm but then the buttons stopped working and the devise would not increase in speed or intensity and nor wood it shut off. No wat to return it on Amazon due to policy"
1,"DISAPOINTED: I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT. I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CAN'T RETURN IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"
1,"Too Noisy: Other reviews state this item is very quiet. Mine makes a very loud grinding noise. If the windows were open, I think the neighbors would hear it. The noise is totally distracting, thus I cannot use this product. If it was quiet as stated by others, I think I might be very satisfied with it. Did I get a ""lemon?"""
1,"Very Cheap: I ordered this after my other rabbit quit working. Thought this one was affordable. Very Very cheaply made and not much power. Smells very bad, so much you could hardly stand to be in the same room as it, let alone use it. If you are going to buy a rabbit do not buy this one. Invest in one a little nicer."
1,"Totally Dissapointed! Like a bad Lover!: I just got this today and have been playing with it for a couple of hours and haven't gotten a decent orgasm. This is my first vibrator/toy ever and I don't think I will be buying any more. Maybe its just me but vibrations do little to nothing for me and the fact that this toys rabbit ears are way too long doesn't help. After playing with it for awhile and just being left frustrated I managed to get a weak orgasm not worth anywhere near the 30 dollars i paid for this! The vibe itself is way too thick and it has a awful chemical smell. I should saved my money! I will continue to try and play around with it but I am not hopeful. The rotating shaft also does NOTHING for me.."
1,"Loved it - till we got it wet!: It is NOT NOT NOT WATERPROOF! Loved it, till we tried it in the tub. Worked for 4 seconds, then stopped. VERY DISAPPOINTED...."
1,"Smells TOXIC and awful: This smells like paint thinner or something. It does NOT go away with washing or airing or anything else, and is so strong my entire ROOM smells like a chemical factory. Aside from the fact that it is a total buzz-kill to have this awful stink, I have no idea if it is save. Who knows what's in/on this thing and I certainly wouldn't want to put it in my body...it could be leaching chemicals. Cancer comes to mind. I had to throw it away. Total waste. Don't buy it, find another supplier!"
1,"Can't use it, can't return it.: I was really looking forward to using this item. However, upon opening it I was overcome with a strong chemical odor. The packaging says ""for novelty only"" which means, it's not safe. I did some research and found out this could actually cause cancer. Of course, I can't even return the stupid thing eventhough I never used it. Shame on you people for selling shoddy products that can esentially kill people."
1,"Large and Hard!: Purchased online, good description with size included. However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again."
2,"Great Quality Toy: This is great, wife loves it. We've actually had 3 of them. Wore out the first 2 over the course of about a year each. This has never failed to please her.The only issue we have noticed with them, is the rubber seems to react with other rubber types and ""melt"". We have had it happen with all 3 of them. So if you keep your toys together (touching) like we do, you may want to keep this one in it's packaging so it doesn't get an impression of another toy melted into it.It does tend to get louder the more you use it or the older it gets. At first it was very quite, but now we have to keep a hold on the rabbit to stop the noise from being overly loud (Especially if the kids are home).Again, all the cons happen over time. We will probably keep on of these as long as we can continue to buy them. It's just really good at what it does even if it doesn't last forever."
1,"Too Weak/Gentle: Received as a gift from my wishlist, I added it because of all the positive reviews and because it was waterproof (also the clear design looked cool), but quite honestly this is weaker than my cheapy $8 vibrator from a local shop. I have not tried it in water so I can't comment on that. It is also too stiff (rather than being too big), but mostly my issue is the very weak vibration, especially lacking in the area that should be stimulated most. The rotation also did nothing for me. With a name like Jackrabbit, I was expecting a lot more oomph. Don't bother with this product if your preference is not gentle... I found it annoying."
2,"hubby vs wife: shipped fast good price good explanation of the detail and all other great aspects of this item...would tell friends about"
1,"Not for me: It is too thick for me and the material is very hard too uncomfortable I would not recommend it because it did not explained how the product really was and even though is brand new in the box never been used you can not return the product . So I just wasted my money..."
1,"one hit wonder: I tried this product. It broke during my first use. Then I contacted the seller and they told me to give good feedback and said they'd send a new one. It's been a month and I haven't received anything. I'm over this company, Joy Hollywood. Clearly they do not know how to treat customers or sell working products. the product not only broke but it, like other consumers said, smelled like something awful. I would feel safer going to an actual store where they actually test the products to make sure they work. or where they will gladly return something that was a LEMON."
2,"WOW!!: This product definitely does what is said to do. I haven't had any problems with it and its not too thick and the power is great."
1,"Horrible!: I have tried rabbit toys in the past and they have all been great, so I was very excited to try this product. I got it in the mail, put batteries in it, and... it wouldn't turn on. I wish I had read the reviews on this more carefully before buying this, as I see now that a lot of other people have had this issue. I really hope I can return it. Don't waste your money- if you want a rabbit, you might as well buy a real good quality one so you don't waste your money like I did."
2,"A quiet ride.: I was pretty surprised at how girthy it was when I opened the package. It is made with quality materials. There was the usual strong odor that tends to come along with new toys. But once soaped up nicely it seems much better. I feel lube is nessecary as a companion with this toy. Which can be a downfall at times. But the fact that it operates very smooth And quiet makes up for this. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase and this brand. I love the fact that the batteries are kept in a tray that makes it super easy to keep them together and ready to go in between uses. Great price, good investment, great pleasure :)"
1,"Great Transaction!!!: Received it broken but when talking to the customer help chat they refunded me ASAP. 110% satisfied with their service..,"
1,"Not a good vibrator: I bought this item 6 months ago and was immediately disappointed. Metallic beads are a almost painful on higher rotation speed. And the the metallic rod connecting the top with the bottom broke after 6 months.Do not recommend this item."
1,"NOT WATERPROOF BROKE IN ONE USE: This is TERRIBLE. I have had this for 3 hours and it is already broken. It is absolutely NOT waterproof. Do NOT waste your money."
1,"Disappointed: I was really excited to receive this product after reading the reviews. A day later I'm quite disappointed. The bunny ears are razor sharp! Oucccchhhhhh!!!Definitely save your money and go for something else"
1,"Awful: I was excited to try this vibrator at first because of the addition of the beads. I was really disappointed in this product however. It's awkward to handle, using it and trying to use the buttons at the same time takes away from the focus on the sensations. The beads are far from pleasure enhancing, they felt awkward and sometimes pinch a bit if you change the direction during use. They are also bulky and and uncomfortable. The plastic is smooth on the outside which isn't necessarily a bad thing but I personally prefer some texture, it's also really thin where the beads are, which I suppose is to allow sensation but considering I didn't like the way the beads felt... I would've preferred thicker plastic."
1,"California Exotics jack rabbit: Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping.."
1,"Not waterproof: I only used it a couple of times, a tiny bit of water leaked into the battery compartment and now it is rusted and won't turn on."
2,"sooo biggggg: I had mixed reviews of this product. It most definitely got the job done, and fast! The only qualms that I had was that it was really large and hard to get in sometimes. Also I found that the rabbit ears would get in the way and could become annoying at times, but other than that it is a GREAT product."
2,"Great after positioned right!: I got this today. As I was putting the 3 AA batteries in I had to try it out. I have a high sitting clit and the clit vib part had to be positioned right. Once I got it positioned right I was in heaven. I had the big ""O"" in a minute (probably under) and it was so intense I was shaking. The buttons were easy to manage once you got the position right. I don't think I will try this in the water since other reviewers have and the toy wouldn't work after. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a great toy. My husband is looking forward to using this on me tonight since telling him how amazing it is."
2,"Seems to be good!: This seems to be good so far only used it once. I really thought that the shaft vibrated but it does not. Love the bullet in the rabbit ears... so far so good!"
1,"Nothing: Nothing to to say about it thank u didn't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money"
1,"Disappointing: Once again I wish I'd paid closer attention to the more critical reviews ... This product is far too rigid and thick. With the beads and other material in the center, it does not bend at all, and it's painful to try to use. There are also rigid bumps around the too-large tip (which is 1.5 inches wide, 5 inches around) that make it even more painful to insert. I've used the similar - but far more realistic - Doc Johnson product (beads and rabbit, but none of those bumps, and a more natural tip and girth) and hoped it was the same thing, but it isn't. On the upside, it's as quiet as the Doc Johnson product - and it'll be even more quiet, unused, in my nightstand. Waste of money."
1,"disappointed: I never actually got to use this product, when it arrived the bottom of the battery pack thingy was missing and when I attempted contacted the California Exotics customer service via both email and phone call I never received a response."
2,"wow: Little different then I was expecting but really good quality and exactly as advertised, fast deliver an great service, thanks"
1,"Ouch!: The ears on the rabbit are sharp and the first time I used it I felt like it cut me after wards. If the ears weren't so sharp this toy would be higher on my list of favorites."
1,"Jack Rabbit: The rotating beads jammed after 2 uses and no longer work. Also the item is non returnable so I can't even return it and get a new one. ):"
2,"Outstanding in and out of water: My wife was skeptical about purchasing a new toy. Until now, she had not cared for any toy we have used. We ended up buying the Jack Rabbit because so many of our friends recommended it. We chose to try it first in the jacuzzi...it only took about 90 seconds. The next morning, we tried it in bed with the same results. My wife is now a huge fan of the bunny ears! I highly recommend this item. But it now!!!"
1,"The worst ever: This is one of the worst one i ever bought. The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. Since this product can not be return, I used it once and went righ in the trash."
2,"Awesome once you find your rhythym!: I bought this because I was tired of wearing myself out in other ways (haha). I am pretty much a nontoy user, but when I saw what all this thing could do and for the price, I was hooked! It came on time in very discreet packaging (Thank you Lord!). A regular Amazon Box and a black bag on the inside, completely sealed. I don't live alone and was worried someone else would open it.I wasn't expecting it to be so HUGE. I took it slow, and was able to use it after a little coaxing. A little painful, but eventually I found my rhythym and it was AMAZING. Controls are easy to reach and the spinning feature is heavenly!So, it takes getting used to if you are inexperienced, but it's definitely worth it!"
1,"Reviews are so off--terrible!: I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money."
2,"Works like a charm: For me, this is pretty much a sure thing. Sometimes I use the rotating beads. Sometimes I don't. It just depends on my mood. The rabbit vibration is stronger when the beads are turned off. The size of the item is pretty long/thick and I do prefer this size to some of the other items I have. My current favorite item. Haven't tested to see if it's waterproof ... too worried that it'll stop working and then I'll be SOL."
1,"False Advertising: The picture shows several items when you select the purple one and has ""alternate views"" showing these items. And the kicker is that its 10$ more than the other colors, so it seems like its a package deal, but I only got the one purple vibe. I totally would have gotten the clear one for less money if I knew that was the case because who cares what color it is really. I, for one, am about function over fashion. FALSE ADVERTISING!!"
1,"Not waterproof!: This thing is awful! The first time I used it water it filled up with water and shorted out. I've dried it, replaced the batteries and it still won't work. I only used it 2 times. This is a total waste of money!"
2,"Holy Crap!!!: This was my first Rabbit and I highly recommend it. It was a replacement of one vibe I had and it was just the plane old plane old, but this thing blows it out of the water literally. Its fun by myself and with my husband. I just really have nothing bad to say, other then the fact it takes me now about 30 sec. But I'm not sure if that's a bad thing."
1,"Yet another disappointed customer: Add me to the list of folks who received a vibrator-shaped paperweight instead of an actual vibrator. I tried two sets of batteries just to make sure, but it was dead. Also, as others have mentioned, the toxic plastic smell was over-powering, so I was a little bit glad it didn't work or I might have been tempted to try it and I may never have gotten that smell out of me. :o)Amazon, understandably, doesn't allow returns on vibrators, but the paperwork for a refund was done in under an hour and I should get it in a few days, so at least that part was easily done."
1,"jams: LOVE the size--no complaints there. Rabbit ears hit in just the right spot. But, the beads on mine jammed up after a single use."
1,"Ehh.: It's way too big for me. I bought it several months ago, and have used it maybe 3 times. It's uncomfortable. Also, the picture is MISLEADING! Inspecting it closer now, I see the little nubby on the pink jack rabbit, but it says nothing about there being several rows of hard, plastic nubbies near the head of the toy. Sad I wasted my money on this product."
1,"Pretty large: Not made for the delicate sized person or in smaller areas of exploration. All features are as described and rabbit is fast on slowest setting. Smaller would be better."
1,"Poor quality: I gave this product as a ""special"" gift to my wife for Christmas, She just loved it for the first 2 times of use, except we had to make sure the kids were asleep because it is loud. Now it just spins away, but no vibrations. She will still use it on occasions, it can still get the job done, but for the money I payed it didn't last near long enough."
2,"SUPERB: This toy took a little getting use to. But after a few times playing with it I was amazing. I wish there were more options for the speed & vibration but It makes me quite happy & I'm not always easy to please. ;-)"
2,"Wife loves this little guy: This is our 2nd one of these. The first one lasted about 2 yrs and my wife was very sad about its passing. But the 2nd is just as satisfying for her as the 1st. Wonderful item : )"
1,"Not pelased: I was not pleased with this product, the bunny ears does not reach my ""pretty bump"".....I haven't used it ever since...I bought another for $25 and it got to the work done way better than this..."
1,"Broken Item: Recieved this item and it was broken. Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress. Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again. Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it."
1,"Looking For Similar to Better Shower Companion: Best Part? Nice Girth (unusual for a rabbit). Worst? Length. I find it too short. And the ""off"" button has stopped working (maybe it wants to keep going and going and going? *L*) I have to untwist the bottom pannel and loosen the batteries to turn it off.Overall it's OK. It does what its supposed to and has worked out OK for the shower, but I'd like to find something similar (but a little longer) for the shower.I also find the head to be a little too stiff, it should be made of something just a little softer."
1,"Broken: I received this product in the mail yesterday, Put in the batteries and the rotating beads do not work. Complete waste of money."
1,"Breaks easily!: I have only had this product for three months, and after a month I was having problems with this product. I have given up on this vibe, and I do not recommend buying this product. Spend the extra money on something that will actually last!"
1,"Looked good, didn't work: This was my first purchase of a vibrator and was very disappointed. It was shipped very discreetly from Amazon directly, but it didn't work. I put in fresh batteries and it wouldn't turn on. I even tested the batteries, they were good, but this rabbit wasn't. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't take returns on this type of personal product. I simple won't buy anything made by California Exotics again. I'll try one of the other brands next time."
1,"Works really well right up until it doesn't: It was a little big for me, but it worked really well until about two weeks ago. And then it just died. Mind you, this is two months after I bought it. I switched the batteries, made sure the ones I put in were working, but I suppose the motor died. I never even used it in water. I don't know about most people, but for $30, you'd think you'd get more than two months out of a vibrator."
1,"Very disappointed: I don't know why this has such good reviews. I purchased it because of the reviews but it's since gone in the trash. It has an awful smell that won't go away. Like a burned plastic smell. It is WAY too big. The rotating beads do nothing for me. Even if you put your hand on the shaft, you have to squeeze to feel the rotation. Don't buy it."
1,"NO WAY!: This product worked for 4-5 times and the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product."
2,"Awesome Product: I bought this for my fianc̩ for during foreplay it was the best thing I bought her! She loves it it makes her go wild she has gets so horny while I use it on her and it makes sex a million times better! She goes crazy while I pleasure her with this vibrator! Than durig sex she is amazing! It was definatly a great added touch to our sex life! If any guys Re lookin to please there women to the max and than have crazy sex afterwords, buy this product cause you will have an expierance of a life time! Awesome product and work amazing! And this is the best price I found on the Internet! Everywhere else I looked was a lot more than amazon! Good luck"
1,"BORING!: I have enjoyed all the Fleetwood Mac albums and thought this video would provide excellent sound tracks from their album Rumors. Unfortunately, both me and my guests were extremely disappointed by boring commentary mixed in with partial sound tracks..... A book would have been more entertaining."
1,"YOU DON'T GET TO SEE OR HEAR THE SONGS: This DVD contains discussions of the songs on Fleetwood Mac's Rumours Album, but not the songs themselves. They tell you about the song, how it was produced, what was going on and then they don't play it. If you are lucky they show about a 10 second video clip. It would not have cost the powers-to-be a dime to show a video of each song after it was discussed. In my opinion this ""Album"" is a tribute to arrogance. I will be sending it back."
1,"Misleading.: Clearly, the producers of this DVD meant to mislead. The cover of the DVD shows the original album cover suggesting that it is a visual equivalent of the album. Please read the cover carefully. It is a quickly put together documentary of the times surrounding the making of the album. Too much time is taken up showning closeups of the of photographic stills that are already on the original album cover and liners.Much time is spent describing the breakup of the relationships.Some of the new performances of the classic songs are again, quickly put together and doesn't provide additional insights.Hastily produced DVD with a misleading cover to cash in on unsuspecting fans."
1,"Zero Stars: Rumours is one of my all-time favorite albums, so I was dying to see this video. The one on the making of Pink Floyd Dark Side of the Moon was a real treat, so I had high hopes for this one. Unfortunately, it is just them saying over and over again that it was difficult being trapped in a small studio together, while they were breaking up. The only thing I did not already know, that I got from this video, is that Mick Fleetwood seems like a pretty nice guy, but the other three are self-absorbed jerks. Listen to the album again and again, but I recommend not wasting your time on this pointless and thoroughly uninteresting video."
1,"A ""Box of Chocolates"": I'm really upset with myself for not more closely reading the reviews that said there wasn't music, just talking about the songs. I like the Fleetwood Mac, but not personally. I thought I was buying a concert performance with commentary. If you don't get a preview, you don't know what you'll get."
1,"A WASTE OF VIEWING TIME AND MONEY!: THIS IS A BLATANT CASE OF FALSE ADVERTISING THAT I'VE EVER SEEN! I'M EXPECTING TO SEE FLEETWOOD-MAC PERFORMING ALL THE SONGS FROM THEIR ALBUM 'RUMORS' (WHICH IS A GREAT PIECE OF WORK!). INSTEAD, ALL I SEE ARE THE RECORDING TECHNICIANS EXPLAINING HOW THEY MIXED THE VARIOUS SONGS, WHICH, BRINGS ME TO MY MAIN BEEF...ONLY BITS AND PIECES OF THE SONGS ARE PLAYED. NONE OF THE SONGS WERE PLAYED IN THEIR ENTIRETY. ALSO, THE INTERVIEWS WITH THE BAND MEMBERS SEEMED TO FOCUS ON WHO HAD AN AFFAIR WITH WHOM AND WHY THE AFFAIR ENDED. WHO CARES? I WANTED TO SEE F-M PERFORM AND WAS VERRRRRRY DISAPPOINTED WHEN THEY DIDN'T. AT LEAST I HAVE MEMORIES OF TWO OF THEIR CONCERTS THAT I ATTENDED YEARS AGO."
2,"Very satisfying and informative.: An honest and articulate accounting of the year that produced one of the finest pop albums ever made.As a musician, I was thrilled by the segments that take place in the studio with the original master tapes, breaking down the arrangements, revealing the extraordinary harmony singing, and exposing unused material.As a fan, I was moved by the almost incredible story of two couples breaking up but choosing to continue their work together. It seems that there could have been no ""Rumours"" without the angst that fueled the songs.Bravo to the producers of the ""Classic Albums"" series."
1,"Don't be fooled this is just a documental: No one song complete, just short clips and explanations about the making of the album, nice but not for a dvd, at least in my humble opinion."
1,"Buy something else: The dvd is a documentory, alot of talking and very little music. I thought it was them in concert. Too much talking"
1,"eBay, here I come!: Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text.I'm glad so many people like it because that means I will have no trouble selling my copy.The sound quality didn't impress me, and the ""specially recorded"" versions of some songs told me only that the members have lost their voices. (offstage: ""Sacrilege! Burn him!"")Even the navigation was annoying - click,click, click, click to get to any one song.Bah!"
1,"Fleetwood Mac Rumours: If you want to hear music, don't purchase this video. Each song is quickly interrupted with current interviews of band members talking mostly of their failed romantic relationships during the recording of Rumours. This should be labeled a documentary, not a music video. The band members do talk about the music, and there are nice clips shot at Sausalito, California's Record Plant showing how particular tracks were mixed. However, I believe using the Rumours album cover on the video packaging deceptively implies that it is a music video."
1,"Confused: I was very much disappointed with this album.I really didn't need to hear of all their problems in life.I did not purchase this album to hear them talk about themselves, I wanted to hear their music, which on this album there is very little. I am sending this album back to Amazon. Stay away if you are looking for music."
2,"Rumours DVD: The Rumours DVD is a retrospective documentary made 21 years after its release. Nothing more and nothing less. It's appeal will primarily benefit those interested in the way the tracks were laid down, the underlying emotions that led to the creation of the individual songs, and hearing bits and pieces of the tracks with the other instruments removed. It's important to remember that no filming occurred in the Record Plant (their recording studio) during the sessions. The film footage that did exist was all post production concert footage; sound quality that is poor by present video based audio standards.With that said, those interested in learning how one of the most emotionally charged albums in Rocks history was created will find the DVD very gratifying. Those looking for film footage of the songs being played in their entirety will be disappointed."
1,"disapointed after watching ""The Dance"": Having seen ""The Dance"" before, I was totally disappointed. I was expecting at least the full songs from the CD, but it has only interviews with the band and commentaries. Also the picture quality on my dvd (I bought Region 2) was just bad quality. Not worth buying."
1,"It's just a nice to OK documentary: It's disappointing to say the least. I'm not sure what Suzzette Phillips is talking about in her review, but on my version the classic album rumors isn't on my dvd. (And nowhere on the disc or packaging does it say the album is contained on the disc. Possibly, there are two versions? Anyway, 75 minutes of interviews about each song, and vintage footage each lasting about 15 to 30 seconds. Nothing new is on here that you haven't seen on any other documentary. It would be great if they played the vintage live selections in their entirety."
2,"entertaining but could have been better: If the archival video footage of the songs had been shown in their entirety, I would rate this DVD a 10+. That stuff is out there, these clips are teasers. In fact, I own some old FM concert VHS tapes which I purchased when new (Tusk documentary, Mirage tour, etc). I look at the vaults on The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac cd and wonder why not DVD? Frustrating, they would look and sound great. Still, I never saw the Rumours photo session footage which is included on this DVD and that was an unexpected treat even if it was too short. I knew at the time of Rumours release that there was a lot of turmoil going on in the band but had no idea to what extent until I watched these interviews. All's well now apparently since they have a new cd due out in April. I sure will miss Christine, though. I recommend this DVD to any old diehard Fleetwood Mac fans who crave anything from those good old days and also to the new ones so that you can learn about their history."
2,"Absolutely wonderful!: I loved this video! Having bought multiple copies of the album, cassette, and finally CD (which doesn't wear out!), it should be obvious that I'm ecstatic about the music. Now, I've added this wonderful inside look to my collection. If you're a Fleetwood Mac ""Rumours"" fan, this is the best gift you could receive from someone! Every Fleetwood Mac fan will love this on their shelf to replay at will. Phenomenal!"
1,"too frustrating for the price: Just bought this at the garden center. Looked solid. However, instructions are completely inadequate. I've programmed these kind of things before. I know it's hard to be able to create all the functions needed with just three buttons, but that's why you need to research what the competition is doing."
2,"So easy: I had no problem setting times and days for the unit to run it is so easy, I have also purchased 2 of the double outlet timers of the same make so that did make easy for me to set the single timer. Fitting to the tap is easy and the unit does exactly what I wanted it for. I would recommend this make of timer to anybody for ease of setting and for how it runs."
2,"It's all good!: This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs"
2,"Solid water timer: I first bought a Ray Padula deluxe water timer.Returned that because it was terrible.Couldn't even keep time!Cheap cheap cheap.Ordered a couple of these and so far impressed.Quality feel and function, made in Germany.I had no problems programming this, very logical.Worked perfectly so far.No comparison to the Ray Padula Time It Deluxe Water Timer.The Claber is like a Mercedes, the Padula, a Kia.But, that is really unfair to Kia.Spend the extra few dollars and return it if I'm wrong."
1,"Not recommended: Pro: Soft-closing valve mechanism prevents water hammer effect.Cons: Programming is not intuitive. Cannot adjust the manual valve-open time duration; it is fixed at 15 minutes (the manual states it is possible to adjust this, but I did not see how). 9V battery didn't last a week."
1,"1. Something Good: I wanted to buy this song but couldn't figure out how to do it from the webpage. I don't have any problem buying Apple products, or ATT products or anyone else's products. But I could not figure out how to buy a song from Amazon."
1,"uhhh yuk!: I love techno and have listened to it since it's onset in 1989 or 1990. This CD, however, has not aged well. In 1992 when this was released I tolerated it because there weren't many techno artists or CDs out there. Now I see that this CD is simply tiresome, crass garbage. Samples of Annie Lennox and Kate Bush are overused and abused and the only reason this drivel was played on the radio or in any club. I think this CD has been stuck under the backseat of my Volvo 244 since 1993. And it probably has gunk on it."
2,"If I was stranded on a desert island with one album...: If I was stranded on a desert island with one album it would be this one. One deep complex song after another. Put on the headphones, close your eyes and take a trip into a world where the beat never ends and melodies play with your emotions."
2,"Where the Cypress Rises: This is an unusually perceptive and open first-hand account of an artist and her family's move to Umbria. Unsentimental descriptions of their everyday joys and frustrations are counter-pointed by the dramatic upheaval of major earthquakes. Ryan articulates connections between the natural and built environments and the adventure of the self; between ancient traditions and contemporary creativity. I found it highly engaging - a page-turner. I'll return to it."
1,"Like the sprial binding, not much else: The spiral binding on this book is it's only positive.I haven't found a single thing in this book I would like to stitch. The graphs are done with colored Xs which make it difficult to distinguish between similar colors, and to imagine what the finished product will look like. The colors are not given in Anchor or DMC format, but in other numbers that you then have to look up the DMC or Anchor numbers in the back. Finally there are very few designs for each category. For example, there are only about four or five small pages of Christmas designs. Christmas is a very large subject to design from. Did they run out of ideas? Rather than this book, buy the Better Homes and Gardens 2000 Cross Stitch Designs. There are so many more designs for many more topics, and stitched pictures are given so you know what you'll be working on."
1,"Garbage.: Product came with no documentation whatsoever, no installation CD. Attempted to install this on 2 computers. ""plug and play"" install did not work. downloaded the appropriate drivers from Soundblaster and informed me that NO soundblaster card was found on my PC. attempted to contact vendor,no email was available, only a long distance phone number. Threw it in the trash."
2,"Just Plain Good Music: Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed."
1,"Paper on ""hand decorated"" box looks cheap: I bought this for my daughter for Christmas. It may be ""exotic"" wood but the paper stuck to the wood is coming off the front left corner and greatly diminishes its beauty. The tea is nice but it's not worth the money, in my opinion. I knew the box wouldn't be hand painted but I thought the craftsman would've done a better job of gluing down the paper."
2,"Reflections from Largely Ignored Golfing Foundation: Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro's students who do good. These pros (male and female now) are true backbone of the sport, feeding the sport. In this case, Claude Harmon Jr. reflects on his father, famous club pro and player who wore the coveted Green Jacket.One clearly learns of life lessons Butch carried to his life and students from his father. Salient to his father's remarkable and here documented career is association with Henry Ford and Ben Hogan.There are many gleanings to take from this for golf, for life. Worth read which is personal and honest and passionate, reflecting the author."
1,"My First Negative Review -- Ever: Others may like this book but I did not.For me, ""The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr."" was a huge disappointment and may be the worst book I have ever read.I kept trying to like this book, but the writing and the message kept getting in the way. Self-promotion is hard to pull off, and for me the author did not successfully pull it off. Reading this book was similar to being on the receiving end of a self-absorbed bore's monologue at a cocktail party, absent the cocktails and the party.The book is less about Claude Harmon, Sr. and more about Butch Harmon, Jr. and how he ""got his life together."" From cover to cover it rings with false modesty, and rationalization of a self-righteous, bullying bravado.My brand new copy did not find its place on the bookshelf with Bobby Jones, Dave Pelz, Jack Nicklaus, and many others. Rather, it has been donated to the recycle bin because we do not want it in our house for any youngster to read."
2,"One of the best: I enjoyed this book tremendously! Butch Harmon tells it like it is, without pulling any punches! This is a story that needed to be told; it really gives us insight into the world of professional golf."
2,"Good Book: I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese."
1,"Not what you think....: This item is not what you think it is. This video is only about the war, not on what horrors were done to the people in the camps. Except for history buffs and teachers, this would not be a good video just for viewing pleasure."
2,"George Elliot's Romola: In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."
2,"everything you expect from George Eliot: Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written. I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites."
1,"Ripped Off: Not worth the money at all. None of the music is mixed togeather, like by a DJ. Most of the songs are not by the original artists! I wish I had never purchased this order, and will never again purchase such an items without being able to hear all of the songs. One last thought,,I was an 80's nightcluber,,, some of the songs I never, ever heard of and they are not good what so ever, just fill in songs."
1,"Entire CS3 family crashes: Effects isn't the only Adobe product in the CS3 family that crashes. We are having issues with all of them. Photoshop which doesn't normally import huge files is now crashing our Mac G4. I'm running Sony's Vegas Video at home which has quite a few ""effects"" add-ons available from other vendors. If Adobe doesn't straighten this out maybe Sony will take up the slack."
1,"Patti Page attempts to sing jazz...: Unfortionately Miss Patti Page doesn't have the talent or chops to pull off a jazz session. Backed here by June Christy's regular orchestra, only shows how bad a singer Page is in comparison to the gifted Miss Christy. Miss Page doesn't have the syncopation, rhythm, or phrasing to attempt a project like this. Doris Day, Roseamry Clooney, and Tony Bennett are pop singers who can easily make the cross-over from pop to jazz, but talentless hacks like Patti Page, Teresa Brewer, and Johnny Mathis only make fools of them selves when trying. Stay awa yfrom this and just go out and buy any CD by Anita O'Day or June Christy, but for Heaven Sake's don't buy this."
1,"Talentless hack takes a whack at jazz singing...: Patti Page ""The Tennessee Waltz Gal"" should never have attemted to record a jazz vocal album, for one she lacks the individuality that it takes to be a jazz singer, number two how can anyone take seriously a singer who sings ""How Much Is That Doggie In The Window."" And three when she sings, she sounds like she doesn't care about what she's singing about, Page is definately not a lyrical singer. Even though Pete Rugalo(the talented jazz vocalist June Christy's regular arranger), who arranged this album, tried to make Miss Page sound listenable, it just didn't work out. Stay away from this CD or any CD that has the name ""patti Page"" on it."
2,"The best eye gel I've ever used!!: I have been using this eye gel for a few years now and while I am approaching 50, my eyes sure don't look it!"
2,"Amazing! Entertaining! I didn't want to miss a second!: I enjoyed every minute of this captivating, lively, and fun extreme sport documentary. I promise that you will be so engaged whether you plan to watch it alone or with a bunch of friends. To be honest, I am not a real sport-fan, but ""Keep Your Eyes Open"" entertained me immensely. Awesome film!"
2,"Their Great Recordings on Vee-Jay: This has 32 tracks from their late 50's early 60's Vee-Jay recordings, including the complete LP Will The Circle Be Unbroken, oop since 1992. Most of the other Vee-Jay stuff is now out of print on CD, so buy this instead of the over-inflated collector's prices for those discs"
1,"I HATE IT: OUR TEACHER MRS GREEN MADE US READ IT AND WE HAD TO DO A BOOK REPORT ABOUT IT!IT SUCKS!!!!!!!!"
1,"Grainy image: I can't resist writing a review, because I rely heavily on what others have to say too.I just bought the 1115 and it's being returned today. I've had an Epson Photostylus 870 for the past couple of years and had a little ink mis-hap (my fault) and thought, what the heck I'll get a new printer figuring the technology has improved, etc. This time I decided to go with an HP because I generally like their products, but I'm going back to an Epson.The quality of photo prints are not even comparable. The Epson prints are clear, crisp and realistic. The HP prints (even at 2400dpi) are grainy and fuzzy.Not to mention that ever since I installed the printer (using USB) my floppy disk drive has been grinding every few minutes. Not sure what's up with that.I will say that the HP is fast and fairly quiet. Printing regular documents on paper of course looks nice, but for ""real"" photo images try Epson.Good luck!"
1,"Uses yellow ink: I would not buy this printer again. It quickly uses up all the yellow ink. This is a common problem with this printer. See Yahoo Answers, search for ""hp photosmart yellow"". I think they should be recalled."
1,"dont bother with XP: I Have had trouble with HP and XP since upgrading. Although they say it is xp compatable with driver, it is not. Will cause system to lock up and when I called HP they blamed XP. Bought a Epson and first time install without a hitch. Hope this helps and God bless you!"
1,"Photosmart pretty dumb: Bought Photosmart 1100 three months ago. Loved it till it thought my color cartridge was bad. Now printer will not recognize any new cartridge. Seems there's a hardware bug that the printer will not reset a flag that indicates failed color cartridge. I've bought 2 new color cartridges and a new black cartridge. Called HP & they had me clean cartridge 3 times, power cycle, and even sent new cartridges. Analyst at HP very nice, thought... still the display flashes ""Color Cartridge Failed"" and ""Replace Color Cartridge"". Won't even print B&W. Dumb thing..."
1,"Epson is better and bad software driver: My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. I paid ~$[money] and he paid only ~$[money] from costco.So, I brought one myself. Epson print better photo than HP 1115.If you think of buying this printer, try Epson first.Also, the driver of HP 1115 doesn't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together. Bad software driver!!!"
1,"Disappointed: I have used this printer for the last two years, though it has not been heavily used. It has completely broken down, will not acknowledge that it has paper, and the ""carriage"" is broken. It will not feed anything through and constantly has paper jams. I have been told by repair specialists that it will cost several hundred dollars to fix it because the ""carriage"" is so expensive. Though it does print beautiful photos, I am very disappointed with this product's performance over time!"
2,"HP workhorse: Great Printer, but does get a bit cranky at times. The 2 side print capability is a plus, saving paper & making printouts more compact. Does a 4 + job on photos, but hard to use the small photo tray. I've used this printer for approx 2 years and just now feel it may be time to upgrade. I feel I made a good choice for my photos."
2,"Neat book for starters into continuous-time finance: Very intuitive in explaining the basic concepts and the fundamental and widely used methods in continuous-time finance. No deep background in math is required to have a good grasp of this book. I believe it is intuition rather than fancy skills that is important to build up interest and passion for studying a hard topic such as continuous-time finance."
1,"one elephant charm? you've got to be kidding.: when i opened the box, i was expecting two elephant charms. what did i get? one. come on. who would buy one?"
2,"KI A Road Anyone Can walk: This is a very interesting book describing KI and how anyone can use it for various applications in life. Anyone would be happy with this book."
1,"Spare us: I purchased this CD for my wife for Mother's Day. After listening to it, it became very clear that Babs is way out of her league when she sings with singers the caliber of Il Divo (whom she refers to as ""swell"" by the way. Swell???). The continual platitudes such as ""children are like sponges"" etc. are boring. At 65 years of age she can at least try to come up with something new to say. As for her political persuasion, who cares!"
1,"Junk Music: Stop listening to her music years ago. How do you explain this person who only comes out to the public when she is promoting a record. Money $$$$$$$ is her only satisfaction that and puting down the United States to anyone stupid enough to listen. Barbie, go join Jane Fonda on your hate tours."
1,"dissapointing: dissapointing in that the duets really do little justice to the songs. The duet5s in particular have beengiven inappropriate arrangements."
1,"Boring: Who'd Have Thought?: Apart from shrinking core of diehard fans, who is going to buy this? Most of the songs appear on other albums, the liner notes are schmaltzy, the sound quality is not that hot, and BS's voice sounds worn and tired.If she really cared, she would tour with all new songs and sing like she was happy to be there and NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS. :)For those of you unsure as to whether or not to buy the CD, wait a month and it will be in the cutout bin.I give this 2 stars in honor of the late Mr. Peter Matz, thanked by BS in the liner notes in her usual pompous way."
2,"Has Streisand stayed too long at the fair? NO,NO,NO.......: Hello People.I had the guilty pleasure of seeing Streisand in Atlanta on Nov 2,2006.I flew form Dallas to Atlanta and i would do it again,I was part of history,some of you people just kill me with your mean sprits,Barbra is barbra none of us are the same when we were in our prime,why not be glad and happy she's out there singing,why must we a people always compare,if your a true fan you will just but the cd and support her,and Mr.Gavin j Mcleod I know your mother taught you better then that but as Barbra has she before it easier to CRITCIZE then praise.come on folk's rise above.The Cd is awesome let's enjoy her and her music ok? OK.God bless you all and remember wouldn't it be wonderful,If we could all be a little more gentle with each other,and a little more loving,have a little more empathy,and maybe,just maybe we'd like each other a little bit more..........Rock on Barbra Srteisad your the best,and Thank you for all the year's......"
2,"Great musice but dissapointed in the actual concert: The music is ok on this, yes her voice isn't what is was in the past but everyone gets older. Still wonderful to hear.I saw Barbra on her first night in Chicago on the 2006 tour and although this fulfilled a lifelong dream of seeing her in concert, I was not at all impressed with her choice of Il Divo. They were overly loud and I hadn't paid $350.00 to see them. And now after seeing clips of Barbra's European Tour shows, I feel robbed. The concert she did in Europe is the one I was hoping for. An entirely different experience and as she will most likely never tour again, there went my one chance to experience Barbra as she should be."
2,"10 Stars at Least!: Brilliant recording, great songs, just enough flavour of the concert without too much talking, not enough singing. Nice to see Herself allow the imperfections that make her human, but still so far above the most perfect of anyone else. She is a treasure of the world."
2,"Streisand:Live in Concert (2 CD's): This is one of the best Barbra has ever done, I have listened to it in full probably ten times since last week when I bought it. It is so incredible. I am waiting for the day that this is out in DVD to see her in action while I listen to her. God has truly blessed her with unbelievable talent."
2,"AMAZING: I am anxiously awaiting the arrival of my CD. I was at the concert in Atlanta and was mesmerized during the entire show. It was so surreal..to be in the company of Barbra and Il Divo. I know the CD will be great. It will be the first thing loaded in my car. And, it will probably stay in there for quite a while. There is and will be no other Barbra. I only wish she would tour more often."
2,"Like Buttah!: Saw Barbra in Atlanta and this is a wonderful album to bring back the memory of an unforgettable experience! I just hope there is a DVD planned!"
2,"Streisand Live - Amazing: Barbra Streisand for over 46 years has been an entertainer beyond words. Her 2006 tour and subsequent 2007 European tour are sell out sensations. This CD captures part of her performance which is quite powerful. The stage presence alone is numbing, the vocals are rich, deep and so moving. The pairing with Il Divo is fantastic, they have brilliant voices, but are eclipsed by the legend. This is a must have for everyone, especially those who weren't able to see her in concert. What could you want more, how about a DVD to go along with it?"
2,"great writing, informative: Every reader of the Frozen Republic will find something to disagree with, but if you have an open mind, you will find that Lazare has many good points about America's government not being the be-all, end-all of democracy.The Frozen Republic is a history of Constitutional (and para Constitutional) problems that America has faced and a description of Constitution worship as America's religion. There is very little on comparative government or a blueprint for change. Lazare appears to favor a parliamentary system, but he does not spell this out in any detail, or say very much about voting reform."
1,"Stainless Steel Outside - All Plastic inside!!: This is one very attractive coffee canister with just one problem. If you're chosing this because you no longer want your food and beverages exposed to plastic, you might want to stay away from this one. The inside area is made entirely of black plastic. However, if plastic isn't an issue for you, this could be your baby.I am disappointed that amazon's normally satisfactory product description process didn't work here. This listing misrepresents the item by failing to mention the non-stainless interior which is a significant fact to many consumers. I returned my canister with my explanation that the quality was not as represented. I don't believe that they should charge their customers for any shipping or restock fees when they don't describe items honestly. Amazon rocks but this listing needs help!"
1,"Too Small: Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section."
1,"Maybe this is only for coffee beans.: Bought this for a gift and was wondering how it would fit coffee grounds and have room for the filters. I thought maybe the filters were under the lid. Well, it must be only for coffee beans and only a small amount. The filter holder takes up one side of the container and it's not for the kind of rippled filters that we use. It holds ones that are flat. The person we bought it for ended up using it without the lid for a utensil holder."
2,"Filter compartment smaller than I thought: Love the look and quality. But coffee filters for a regular sized coffee maker do not fit in the filter compartment."
1,"Costs $10.89 at Target online: Costs much less at Target but I won't buy it because of bad reviews on Amazon. Will buy a bigger canister when I find the right one."
1,"misleading cd: This is not Lighthouse. This is the ST Luke UMC Lighthouse Praise Band. I am returning it to Amazon because it looks like Chrstian filler."
1,"Poor quality and Customer Service- buyer beware: Received this as a gift from my husband. He had it gift wrapped and held it for the occasion. When I opned the bracelet, we were both very disappointed. The quality was very poor and bracelet did hand nicely on the wrist. He contacted the seller through Amazon to request a refund. They refused to refund or exchange the item. Unfortunately he had not opened the item when it was received, since it was gift wrapped. He held it beyond their return window, as he was saving it to be gifted. I called the vendor myself to explain and seek a compromise. They were unyeilding, explaining that they could not return the bracelet to their vendor or restock it, so we were out of luck. Beware of the return policy with this vendor especially if it is a gift."
1,"Great idea--terrible design!: Bought this for my 5 year old Justice Leaguer. My son is not a rough player but we went through 4 (YES, FOUR) of them before we finally got one where the elevator didn't break in the 1st 2 weeks. Mattel needs to get their act together and design toys that have durability. VERY disappointing!"
1,"Big Disappointment: I purchased this for my son who is a huge Justice League fan. He gets discouraged because it is always falling apart. I hate it, because I am always putting it back together. I would not recommend anyone buying this toy unless you want to keep putting it together."
1,"Bad Design, just buy the figures: We bought this for our 5 year old for Christmas. The elevator uses a string pulley which promptly bound around the gear that connects it to the thumbwheel which raises and lowers the platform. Within 5 minutes of playing, one of the main features broke. Also, the top has a ring with 5 rockets, one of these came missing a retaining pin. Thoroughly disappoingting as he is a big Justice League fan."
1,"Buy your children this toy if you want them to hate you.: This is a huge disappointment for my family, and has forever left a stain on the memory of my son's recent birthday. This piece of garbage cannot, does not, and will not stand up. And it does not stay together. And the elevator breaks easily. And some of the figures don't fit in the elevator.So there it lies, in pieces, in the corner. And here I lie, curled in a ball in the other corner, wondering if I am an inadequate father because I can't make a $40 piece of crap stand up.I hope whoever designed this goes back to creating torture devices."
2,"A must for any JL fan: My 3 year old son is OBSESSED with Justice League! Needless to say he HAD to have the watchtower! I too had read the bad reviews and ended up getting it here on Amazon! Yes the three legs don't stay on but after a week of putting them back on a hundred times a day I got out the superglue to secure them on and I have not had a single problem since! Granted you don't want to have to superglue a toy that should work on it's own but if your kid loves JL just buy some glue too!"
1,"Don't waste your money: This watchtower was never used by the manufacturer because the unit itself comes with 3 legs that could likely hold one pound of weight and this weighs several. The ""legs"" don't even lock in place, they just sit in groves so the minute you place the weight on it they collapse over and over. If you manage to get it to stand the minute your child touches it it will fall over. Otherwise it would have been a wonderful toy. It looks like the show and the body is sturdy and well put together. Too well put together to be supported by the legs provided. Don't buy it, if your child is younger talk them into the Spiderman playset, much more sturdy."
1,"A very bad choice: The designers threw in the works and the lone star represents a point for design ingenuity. Problem is this toy is nearly impossible to build and it's more than the comically unreadable directions that are at fault. I have built many a toy but never found one this resistant to having its snap on parts snap on and of course if and when they finally do, the least shake will undo your labor. Sure to end in tears and frustration for all."
1,"A PIECE OF JUNK!: Do not buy this toy - it has been a source of frustration and disappointment for all 3 of my children. Difficult to put together (and I have assembled my share of kid's toys), it will not stay together at all. It is challenging (at best) to get the figures in the elevator, and none of the figures with capes will fit - they tend to get stuck halfway up. The elevator also requires the child to turn a little wheel to get it to go up - too difficult for little ones. It requires a degree in engineering to get the little plane to fold up inside the watchtower - very poor and frustrating design. The noises are also weak as are the features (i.e. the trip wire, rockets, the plane). Just a complete waste of money - it is only a couple of weeks old, and it is headed to the trash."
1,"Don't waste your money: This toy was not that difficult to put together, but we have to put it back together each time my son plays with it. The set is always falling apart. The elevator broke after the first day. My friend bought this for her son as well, and she is just as frustrated as we are. I would not recommend buying this unless you have hours to spare re-assembly it and keeping up with all the parts that contiunally fall off it. [...]"
1,"Not for children to PLAY with!: This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!"
1,"Garbage!: My 5 year old son received this as a birthday present, and it is headed right back to the store. The legs do not stay on, it falls over when touched, with or without the legs, there is a missing door, the elevator gets repeatedly stuck. As much as my son loves the idea of this toy, he has given up and resigned to playing with his other toys because this one is garbage, and a pure waste of money."
1,"Frustrating piece of junk - do not recommend!: I bought this for Xmas 2004 after all the clever marketing hype. The rocketship theme looked very cool and rugged in the pictures. However, when my son got it it - it turned out to be nothing but a frustrating, unplayable toy. It falls down constantly because of poor design: the legs can't support the weight of the whole rocket when touching it), the elevator doesn' work (gets jammed all the way up) and it didn't even come with any character figures -these are sold separately! I may have to glue the parts together just so he could play with it some more time before we dump it.Do not recommend!"
1,"Not very durable: This toy was a pain to put together, and even worse to stay together. The elevator won't work, and I had to forcefully put some of the pieces together. Most people who reviewed this toy, had the same complaints, but I bought it anyway, because my nephew really wanted it. I'm glad that I only paid $15.00 for it, because it's not worth any more than that. Some pieces came off, before my nephew even got a chance to play with it."
1,"A nice showpiece but falls apart with the slightest touch!: What a colossal disappointment this turned out to be! The Justice League figures are the best superhero figures to come out since the Super Powers figures of the 1980s. They're colorful, durable, playable, and collectible. The Javlin 7 ship is also a nice piece for the Justice League collection. Imagine my disappointment over the Watchtower. While cool to look at, this toy is for display purposes only! As others have noted, it's shaky and falls apart with the slightest touch. What were the designers thinking when they created such flimsy legs for this heavy toy to be supported on? Also, the doors fly open quite easily. This toy will sit on my shelf with all the figures displayed on it. If you have small children avoid this at all cost and save your $35."
1,"Son loves it, but it does fall apart: My son does love this toy and plays with it every day since Santa brought it to him. It has fallen apart each time he plays with it and has fallen on him a couple of times, so if you have a small child, I wouldn't recommend it.I will attempt to GLUE the legs on, since they are the biggest problem for this toy. Everything else works just great. Elevator, noises, guns, etc."
1,"Another lame mattel product: Please don't waste your money on this one. My four year old son loves the justice league and thinks this toy is pretty great. The problem is the elevator for one never worked and the tower is supposed to be supported by three crappily made narrow suction looking thingys. The minute my son goes to open one of the towers sides the whole damn thing collapses. This happens everytime. I finally just took the three support things off of it and put them away. The gun launcher thingys on top also continue to fall off. Luckily my sons was purchased on sale for only $14 but it's made so cheap and frustrated my son so much that I still feel completely ripped off."
1,"Watchtower is total crap!!: Avoid this toy at all cost. It falls apart when touched. The elevator stopped working almost immediately. Total rip off."
2,"My daughter loves this toy: I bought this for Christmas. It was somewhat challanging to put together properly, but after that it was quite fun for my five year old. I know when she plays with this due to the sound fx."
1,"A peice of Junk: When you put it standing up on its legs, it falls down. A friend of mine has one. He tried repeatedly to get it to stand up, but it just fell down with the slightest touch! After a while we were realy fed up. It was over $39.00!"
1,"A toy not made to last: This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. I would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself."
2,"Very well acted and directed: While the first half feels predictable and very TV movie, theperformances are good enough (especially Helen Mirren) to keep itgoing.And in the second half, this tale of a collage student mother's helperhired to help a woman in an angry depression after suffering a nervousbreakdown gets more complex and unpredictable.The relationship between the two women, and they way their damagedsouls play off each other is quite moving and grown up.Strong subtle direction by Kevin Bacon.Does take a hit for over the top performances from the kids, and otherkey small roles, all playing types, not human beings."
2,"Batcave a good buy!: My boys got this for their birthday and I put it together the night before. It is quite large and impressive and my boys' friends found it their most impressive present. One friend thought it was the neatest toy he had ever seen. My sons actaually spent more time playing with their Justice League Watch Tower but this toy was next most popular. They already had all the Batman and sidekicks action figures to go with it so it worked out perfect. My sons still play with it every day. Well worth the money."
1,"Catastrophe Cave!: The advetising on the box caught my attention so I bought this playset for my son's birthday. It was a complete waste of money! The toy design is terrible! The batcave falls over when played with. The elevator doesn't function properly either. Because of all the malfunctions and collapes, my son lost interest within five minutes of play. If you want your child to have a Happy Birthday or Merry Christmas go with something other than this toy."
1,"Great idea, poorly engineered: Where were the engineers for this toy, is what I'd like to know. What a great idea it is, but it just doesn't hold up to play. Now, I suppose if you're willing to bolt it into your basement wall, then it would hold up to some strong playtime. However, it is almost completely incapable of withstanding any play whatsoever without collapsing onto the floor. I highly recommend you read all the other reviews on this toy prior to purchase. Definitely needs to go back to the drawing board - ours went back to the store! What a disappointment!"
1,"DO NOT BOTHER: This is toy so frustrating. Very hard to put together and even harder to get the working parts to work without the entire thing falling apart! My son loves batman and this was a gift from his Grammy so he is using it but I had to mount is to a special board to keep from falling into pieces and then tape it together! By next week it will find the dumpster. Waste of time and money and worse yet truly frustrating for my 5 year old.."
2,"Imagination at its BEST!: Yes, this item may be a little tippy. But find a way to attach it temporarily to a wall and it stays just fine. My son plays with this all the time! It is great! He pretends with his Batman, Superman, Spiderman toys and uses his imagination to capture the bad guys! It is a very cool toy and well worth the money."
1,"WORST TOY EVER!: After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!"
1,"Fun, But Falls Apart: I bought this toy for my son's fourth birthday in September. I did not have problems putting the toy together and initially my son loved it. He and his friends played for hours and hours. The arms and ropes, etc. led to a lot of imaginative play. However, in my opinion the design is flawed and the quality of the toy, in general is very poor. The elevator never worked properly because, after awhile, the height of the toy causes it to sag one way or another and the elevator would get stuck. Also, the elevator was not big enough or offitted to hold the Batman figures, so when my son would put a figure in the elevator, it inevitably would fall over and jam the elevator. We've already thrown the toy out, a few months later."
1,"Batcave - get in touch with mattel: Like most of the other reviews here I bought the Batcave for my four year old and it was a disaster. I paid around 39 for it and see it's now retailing for 9. It just doesn't work. It's a pathetic toy. However I got in touch with Mattel and on the second attempt (they didn't respond first time or didn't get my e-mail) they phoned to offer me a choice of replacement toys. Hope everyone here has done this or will do it - complaining is the only way toy manufacturers will learn."
1,"BATMAN TOYS NEEDS BETTER QUALITY: I think MATTEL needs to fire the team who makes all the Batman toys, & hire a team of people with quality & creativity in mind. This one of many Batman toys my 6 year old son has, every 5 minutes he comes to me to put the toy back together agian. (I glued together last years modle of the car, the 'wings' always fell off!) the cave is very top heavy, with a flimsy support & backing. If you don't have a permanent wall space to stick this toy on to it will fall as soon as you walk away! Plus there are three pices to this toy that would fall off as soon as I put on that we didn't need anyway."
1,"Very Disappointed ...: Well - this was my son's #1 request from Santa Claus. Despite the reviews, he brought it to our house. As expected, it is quite flimsy. It is sad to watch my 5 yr old struggle with the elevator while trying to give batman a ride. It is so pathetic how these toy companies take advantage of children, and (their parents!) with such poor quality merchandise."
1,"Waste of money: Horrible toy for a my 4 year old son who is a batman fanatic... flimsy and not durable. Can not get the elevator to work properly always jams up. This toy won't last to long."
1,"Worst Toy Ever = Batman Animated Batcave: Do not buy this toy. If you are given this toy as a gift, return it for store credit. This is a flimsly and poorly designed stack of platic and paper. The secret door doesn't work, the elevator doesn't slide and toys get stuck in there. The suggested 10"" batman doesn't work with the zip line, bungee or even the elevator. The add says ""Using new adhesive technology, you can set up the Batcave on just about any wall"" so they want us to glue this thing on to a wall.Please don't buy this toy."
1,"JUNK: MY SON SAW THE NEW TV SHOW AND WANTED THE NEW BATCAVE. HE HAD THE ORIGINAL ONE BUT BOTH HIM AND I WERE IMPRESSED WITH THE SIZE. DO NOT LET THIS FOOL YOU. IT IS BUILT VERY FLIMSY. THE PARTS FALL APART EASILY. THE ELEVATOR CANNOT BE USED UNLESS YOU HAVE THE PROPER BATMAN DOLLS TO PUT IN THERE . THE CARDBOARD BACKING FALLS OFF. THE STICKERS ARE A PAIN TO PUT ON. I SPENT 2 HRS ON X-MAS EVE PUTTING TOGETHER THIS CAVE. MY SON HAS IT STUCK IN A CORNER. HE HAS MORE FUN LINING UP HIS ACTION FIGURES ON THE COUCH AND USING HIS IMIGINATION THAN THIS TOY. DO NOT GET IT. THE ORIGINAL BATCAVE IS BETTER. SMALLER BUT BETTER."
1,"Batcave Warning!!! Caution!!!: WARNING!!! CAUTION!!! Parents do not waste your hard earned money or valuable time with this toy. I am the proud father of two boys who were so excited to receive this batcave from Santa. Boy were they disappointed with the substandard quality. This has to be the worst display of a children's toy that I have seen in awhile. I feel that Mattel has stolen from me by misrepresenting this gypsy junk as an actual toy. Please do not purchase!"
1,"BAT GUANA!: This thing is a major piece of junk. It doesn't stick to the wall like it claims. You have to stand to play with it (cause all the cool stuff is at the top), and the extension pieces constantly fall off. I actually screwed it to the wall, but that lasted a whole 10 minutes as it wouldn't stay screwed into the wall. Then the scenery kept falling. Save your money and buy the cool batmobile or something."
1,"Wrong Bruce, you idiots!: Bruce BANNER turns into THE HULK, not THE BATMAN, morons! It's BRUCE WAYNE who turns into Batman. Maybe this toy would get better reviews if product specialists spent a LITTLE more time researching the list of who transforms into whom.Hulk SMASH stupid Batcave!"
1,"Mattel + Batman = JUNK TOYS!: Just ""assembled"" the bat cave for my 5 year old. Pathetic construction and workmanship -- half of the gimmics don't work. Another pile of injection-molded plastic parts and stickers that I get to assemble -- what is this thing -- $4 of raw materials + $2 of shipping + $10 of marketing? Garbage. Shame on you Mattel, the only thing worse is the batman figures with the batarangs that take 30 minutes and a blowtorch to get out of the packaging. This batcave will collapse and die within hours of play, I'm sure of it. GARBAGE!"
1,"Fun For a Few Minutes, Until it needs fixing AGAIN!!: My son really wanted this toy and loves batman, so Grandma splurged on this expensive-for-what-you-get toy. First thing, it's a real bear to set up, and then when you do set it up it is really clumsy and pieces fall off very easily. The boys still had fun playing with it, even when the elevator constantly got jammed. They would have enjoyed it even more if they actually included at LEAST ONE character figure in the darn set. OOOPs, we did not notice until he opened the gift that the action figures used for the set were sold separately. All in all, don't waste your money."
1,"a monumental waste of money: I bought this batcave for the grandson for Christmas because the older model was no longer available. I was leery about the height of the toy and the bad reviews, and with good reason. Every time I turn around, there's a piece of it that has to be put back on. And I didn't realize until I read the other reviews that there is an elevator. Ours has never worked. My grandson likes the toy, but is getting bored with it, since it's always falling apart and quite a few of the gadgets don't really work. Don't buy this toy!!"
1,"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing: We bought this for my 4 year old son for Christmas and I am very sorry we spent our money on it. Putting it together was not fun, but the real disappointment came when it was done and you see what it is. I think it is unrealistic to think that most people will want to or ever allow this toy to be STUCK to the wall with an adhesive (it says not to leave it stuck there for long periods of time - you must remove it from the wall after playing with it - which means this flimsy piece of plastic is now laying on the floor). After playing with it for 10 minutes, the elevator gets stuck. The top keeps falling off, everytime I turn around my son is whining that this came apart or that came apart. I assume I will be super gluing it before long. I feel ripped off as a consumer. Buyer Beware!"
1,"Good Concept. VERY VERY Flimsy: I got this for my 5 year old. I loved the concept, unfortunatley I never seen such a flimsy toy. We had to super glue everything together because pieces would fall off, this is because there are no snaps to keep levels in place but rather just fits together. Would not buy this toy!!!!!!!!!!! Would not recommend this toy unless your willing to super glue all parts!"
1,"POOR QUALITY: I have been buying toys for my kids as well as my niece and nephew for 14 years and this is the worst quality toy I've purchased! In fact, I had better quality toys when I was a child. My 3 year old son insisted on having this for Christmas and he loves it despite the fact that we have it leaned against the wall to hold it up. It comes with adhesive but I don't want to risk damaging our walls. It is very top-heavy (the 3-level batcave is help up by a couple light-weight plastic tubes)and, though the idea of all the parts snapping in place is nice, I actually had to glue one part in place so it wouldn't fall in the floor. Speaking of pieces, there are a million of them! The directions could be written better also. I read the other reviews here after my son had his heart set on this toy and wish I could have talked him out of this one. Fortunately, he has enjoyed playing with it despite all its flaws but he got better quality $10 toys for Christmas than this one!"
1,"Don't Buy The Batcave: My 4 year old son received the Batcave for Christmas. I know it is about $40. It took my hubby 1/2 hour to put together - is EXTREMELY flimsy & my son got batman stuck in the bat elevator within the first 2 minutes of using it. Soooooo not worth it. What a let down."
1,"Flimsy...not worth the effort!: Although, it doesn't break the bank, it is terribly disappointing. It barely stands by itself and is frustrating to both my sons, whereas all the pieces fall off or don't line up properly."
1,"Save Your Money: I have previously purchased a Ross Berstein book (""Gopher Hockey by the Hockey Gopher"") and found that to be an entertaining read. Not so with this offeringAll Berstein seems to have done is find some of Herb's friends, turned on his tape recorder and then transcibe their comments, verbatim. The print is too small, the words and thoughts are redundant and the small paperback has the look and feel of a self-published work, which it is.The range of interviewees is tiny compared with the breadth of Brooks' life and all the interviews sound the same. There were a few pictures of young Herbie the player. Those are fairly interesting, but I found myself a little disappointed with this offering."
1,"I wish it were a better book: In the book, author Bernstein notes that he writes 5 books a year. It shows. His books are poorly written: full of irritating grammar and spelling mistakes and lacking even the most basic story development.It's a shame Brooks wouldn't play the big NY publisher game--get an agent and find a talented ghost writer to work with on a memoir--or work with an established sports journalist on a well-researched, thoughtful biography. This book is just a collection of random thoughts from Brooks' friends and family. Many of them say interesting things, but without a persistent interviewer to ask the follow-up questions, few of the anecdotes yield much new insight."
2,"Thrilled! And Warm!: I bought this to help heat a bath off my master bedroom. It works like a charm I run it for twenty minutes prior to hopping into the shower and no more shivering!"
1,"Boring, One Sided, Inaccurate: My review title pretty much says it all.One sided books are fine if not disguised. This book has an agenda, anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Facts contained are presented with all the reasons one should be anti Wal-Mart and pro union. Many facts aren't fact, like the statement that Asda took over J Sainsbury's in 2003 - didn't happen.As the world's largest and most successful retailer there are many more interesting books about Wal-Mart. Fine if you're anti Wal-Mart or pro union.......but don't preach, make a book, let me decide!"
1,"Unacceptable: The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"
1,"Keep looking if you want a portable mixer: I purchased this unit for its battery powered portable usage. It fails miserably as it produces so much hiss it is unusable. I mean it is poor with a captital P.The phantom power does not work when in battery mode, nor does the clipping LED's. Keep on looking if you want portability."
2,"10 Channel Mixer: I bought this mixer for my husband off his wish list. He was very excited and loves it!!!!!"
2,"What's not to like?: Easy to read yet scholarly. Great illustrations. Space in the margins for notes. Good chapter overviews and summaries. Nice T/F questions to prime the reader. Sources used appropriately. It is truly the ideal textbook.The format, layout, and writing style make this the text that other writers should follow."
1,"take a different class: After a semester using the text i have come to the conclusion that the authors, Brehm, Kassin, and Fein, leave more questions then answers and that their sub-par sense of humor is more then just a waste of money. After reading certain sections i get the feeling that the authors do not clearly understand the issue at hand, but rather throw 15 different research studies at the topic covering their uncertainty and topping it off with a dire attempt at a joke leaving the reader completely ambiguous."
1,"Attempts at Classification: I'm not sold on social psychology. Part of my issue with this discipline is my personal fight to never let people pigeon-hole me and this seems to want to it on a grand scale. Some of the text does not help one see how issues of individual psychological development tie in to the study of social psychology. This is a great failing because many people no very little about this topic."
1,"waste of money: the kit doesnt even fit the heater outlet vent on the 75K btu model. half the parts you wont need, just go to a hardware store & buy the ones you need for half the price."
2,"Outstanding Book: From the persective of a U.S. Army Officer, I highly recommend this book. Mr. Hoiback does an excellent job, in a very concise manner, to describe the linkage between Authority, Intent, and Dissemination of command. He then uses two case studies that show the relationships in the real world.I really appriciated the second case study showing the opening days of WWII in Norway. The case study told the story of COL Erickson who took the initiative to sink a German Cruiser amid the cowardice of the politicians and the inadequate preparations to maintain Norway's neutrality; a story I never read before this book. I would recommend reading the second case study before the first case study discussing the GEN Haig in the First World War. By reading the Second Case study first, I believe that case study one will be easier to follow.Eric"

1,"might be a good scanner: my scanner hasn't worked since the day i took it out of the box, installed the software, and the green light is on but when i hit scan it does nothing! looks like it's a dud. lol."
1,"Crap, Crap, Crap!!!: There is no other way to put it. All Visioneers are garbage. Purchased my 2nd one (after first one died for no reason after a year) and have experienced many problems. Lately it won't let me scan anything because of an error saying to ""unlock your scanner"". There is no Freakin lock on the darn thing!!! After contacting the company many many times (btw - there customer service sucks! - No telephone number, unless u pay $2 per minute, just a computer-generated machine that unsuccessfully helps you called SARA). I finally put a claim in through the Better Busines Beaureau, there response was that they couldn't send me a new scanner cause it was after 1 year of my purchase, but they would be so kind enough as to let me purchase a new one and give me 25% off of their price (which was probably an elevated price). I told them to kiss off! Anyway - please don't buy this product or any Visioneer product - they Suck!"
1,"Don't buy this scanner: I loved the slim design and the USB power so I could power it with my notebook's USB port. The software was an upgrade to the other visioneer scanners I've owned over the years, which is easy to use. However after only a few hundred scans, there's a growing progressive distortion on the left side of images as if blackened, resulting in a very poor scan. I'm throwing it away. Buy something else."
1,"Do Not Buy This Scanner: Absolutely the worst software for flatbed scanner I have ever encountered. Scan is slow and softcover lousy. Don't buy"
1,"Intentional Obsolescence -- 2011 and it still no drivers!: Vista has been out for 4 years, I'm up to Windows 7, and they still haven't released a driver update for this scanner!This is what's called planned obsolescence, where they intentionally make something not work so that you have to buy the new version. There's no reason or excuse for Visioneer not to release an update.This was the last scanner I'll ever buy from Visioneer. How can I have any confidence that they won't do the same thing with their new scanners when I upgrade computers again?"
1,"It doesnt work with Vista: The price was excellent but the standard shipping was very slow. It doesn't work with Vista, no drivers, so is useless to me. I gave it to my son and it works fine with Windows XP. My son has used it to scan pictures for me and it is of good quality."
1,"Save yourself the trouble: I'm pretty tech savy, and This is by far the worst experience ive had with ANY piece of electronica ever. Dont let the low price fool you, theres a reason for that. The drivers are terrible for this, Uninstalling this scanner requires 4 different programs, tech support charges you money for help (even though I bought this 2 weeks ago), and if you actually get the scanner to work it will take a good 25 minutes to get the 1200 dpi resolution scan. Also the software it comes bundled with (Scansoft Paperport) is horrible, i have 2 gbs of Ram and it ran as if i had 128 mb. the TWAIN compatibility is awful, and it isnt compatible with any third party software. I wish there was something good I could write about this scanner, Aftr 2 weeks I got fed up, returned the scanner and bought an HP. People please do not hurt yourself by buying this awful piece of junk."
1,"Don't buy this scanner: I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight. However, if you have a Vista operating system, like I do, IT WILL NOT WORK! The company told me that they stopped selling this product over a year ago and there are no driver updates available for this product. If you have an older computer and an older operating system this product might work for you. But as for me it was a waste of money!"
2,"Forget The Hype! This is a Great Record!: Forget that Capitol records killed this band's career by letting the public believe that Klaatu was the Beatles secretly reunited (shame on them)! Forget that the name of this band was taken from a Sci-Fi movie (Like Duran Duran didn't do the same?)! Forget that The Carpenters covered thier best known song! Just forget all that junk, and LISTEN TO THE RECORD! YES! LISTEN! This band should have been BIG! It's sad that they only gained a cult following. There are so many fine elements on this record. Who cares about ths stinking singles charts? Who said good music had to be POPULAR? This is just a great LP. It has stood the test of time, and made it to CD. Thank god somebody in the industry recognizes a classic LP when they hear one. So, they weren't the Beatles...they never claimed to be. And Who Cares? Just Listen to the record. It speaks for itself."
2,"real life hero: just as good now as when i bought the album when it first came out. good diversity in the music. This album was originally thought to be the Beatles reformed."
2,"Klaatu: It was a replacement for the one that was ""stolen"" by my now ""ex"" about ten years ago...The replacememt was in excellent condition and it was just as good (or even better) than the one that was taken...Klaatu was a innnovative band...It's a shamethey didn't catch on well here.."
2,"Beatle mutation music at it's pop cosmic best!: ""Subrosa Subway"" hooked me right in. ""Calling Occupants"" a masterpiece. No one thought it could be done...the Beatles sound in an experimental way, but my goodness, an attention and care to arranging was astounding. No mop top hype to hide behind.The fact that they wanted it released with no individual song credits made it feel like a group effort. As they wanted no one to look at the album in none other way than an experience. And they the achieved with flying colours. This album is the reason I even got into songwriting or noticed songwriting as an art form.Indeed a special album for me all time."
2,"HELL'S Yeah!: This live recording of Incantation IS a must own. Very few copies were put into circulation and I picked up my copy via amazon's used marketplace a few weeks ago. I love their studio albums and this live album is outstanding. The drums sound great as well as the production values. A must own."
2,"Small and mighty.: Not since Johnathan Livingston Seagull have we had a book that speaks to the power and beauty of a small bird. Iridescent Soul's main character is the hummingbird, but its message is for the human soul.It is beautiful, light, transcendent, and hopeful. A great gift!"
1,"Terrible Picture Quality: Do yourselves a favor and DO NOT buy this DVD. I think ever since the UFC switched to a different DVD distributor, the quality of their DVD's has gone through the floor. The picture is almost unwatchable because it is so blurry. I'm amazed that they even release stuff that basically has bootleg quality. I bought this DVD to enjoy watching Silva/Franklin over and over and over again, but I started getting a headache two minutes into it. Stay away from this. The UFC needs to do something about this because it's unacceptable for a company so successful to release such low quality garbage."
2,"Growing Up Elsewhere: A former ""diplobrat"" who grew up abroad, I identified with Godden's description of a child's first encounter with France. The effect of their foreign adventure on each family member develops along with an excellent plot (not usually Godden's strong point). Even better than the character descriptions is the evocation of French country life at its most seductive -- ""next best to being there."""
1,"Did not like: Just not my type of book. Very boring but I got through it. Hard to stick with it until the end."
2,"Just what I wanted: Thanks for providing me with an oldie but goodie. The Greengage Summer came to me in great condition for an older book."
1,"Fine for children, boring for adults: One has to be a young adult to enjoy this book. If you want to read about children in a foreign country without adult supervision, well, there you have it. I'm surprised it wasn't turned into a Disney movie.Definitely a children's book."
1,"Does not work for Ipod connectivity on PC's: Bought this card to connect my dell 8100 to my ipod remixed. Installed the card in a snap without incident. Tried connecting my Ipod and it immediately started charging so I thought I was good. However, I opened itunes and nothing. Went to the iogear website thinking i needed to update the driver when I stumbled across the statement on the Tech Support Library, document #10162:""Why won't my IPod work with the GUF320?Both the IPod and mini-IPod require a Windows Hardware Quality Lab (WHQL) certified card to connect to the computer. At this time, the GUF320 is not WHQL certified.We apologize for any inconvenience.""Well that would have been nice to know before I ordered the card and wasted my time and effort."
1,"USB ports won't work with iPod: Bought this card to use with an iPod, and was greatly disappointed. My new iPod only comes with a cable to connect to USB 2.0 ports, and the USB ports on this card DO NOT WORK with iPods. I had to go buy an additional cable (iPod to Firewire) in order to get my iPod working. The Firewire ports on this card DO work with an iPod, but you'll need a Firewire cable that new iPods may not give you."
2,"Plug and Go Go Go!!: No fuss, no muss. Just plug it in the PCI slot and reboot. Windows XP installed it automatically and I was up and running.It could not have been easier unless someone else did it for me...."
1,"Not G5 Compatible: Though the description states this card will work with G3 and above it wont even fit in the PCI slot for a G5 1.8 Single or a1.8 Dual I belive its because those slots are PCI-X. I am going to try the Sonnet alegro which says it will work with a G5 also. We'll see.The Sonnet alegro works!"
1,"Bad quality: Installation and use was easy and good. But the quality of the product was really bad and it was going loose and stopped working in between."
2,"good value, works like a charm!: This card installed without a hitch on my Dell Dimension with Windows XP Pro (Service Pack 2). It wasn't even necessary to install any drivers; Windows simply detected the new FireWire and USB devices and installed them without prompting.The device works great. I noticed a huge increase in transfer speeds coming off my USB 2.0 capable digital camera (my Dell came stocked with USB 1.1 only).I would definitely recommend this PCI card!"
1,"Easy installation but unreliable Firewire slots, slow warranty repair: I've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently. I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card. But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot, the camcorder worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement. Everything seems to be working now. I would now rate this about 3 stars."
1,"Does not work with PowerMac G5: Although the specifications state compatibility with macs G3 or higher, this card will not fit into the pci slot of a new G5.(...)"
2,"Rockin' In Rhythm...: I listened to the first track, Rockin' In Rhythm five or six times before going onto the second track; and experienced the delight of discovering something truly good and remarkable from two artists, about whom I thought I knew everything good and remarkable. Back in the 1970's I collected Ella songbooks on vinyl (Gershwin, Porter, Rogers & Hart), but never got around to the Ellington collection. How fortunate that I inadvertently saved this little gem for a rainy day. Listening to it is like discovering Ellington and Ella anew. Except with the added appreciation of a fan. I would never tire of Rockin' In Rhythm, so reliable a source of joy it is...my soul smiles for the privilege to witness this collaboration."
1,"Not Enough Choices: There are not enough color selections for the average person. The product seems to work but Coverblend needs to work on offering more color selections as women come in a variety of shades and skin tones."
2,"not immoral: this book is surely one of the best. its meaning is crystal clear : in life better strong than weak. the fact is that the king doesn't steal food or money like those weak officers , he just buys low ans sells high. what clavell wants to say to us is that making money out of other people's stupidity is much better than being stupid."
2,"Truly and excellent book.: Actually, I rate this an 11. This was the first, and the fifth, and the last Clavell novel that I have read (yes, I read it three times). Clavell even coproduced an excellent movie adaptation in the late 60's (though filmed purposely in black and white) which captured the entire mood of the book. The reason that this book works so well is that Clavell himself lived the story. The character of Peter Marlowe is based on Clavell himself, and it shows.This book is a brutal, depressing display of humanity at its basest. Not for the light hearted, but a must for anyone interested in WWII or in Asia."
2,"A wonderful tale!: This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book - it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism thrown in for good measure.Again, it is a wonderful book. It will stay with you for a long time."
2,"Not for those looking for an uplifting read.: I'll be honest, this is a depressing book. But it is about a depressing subject. This is a semi-autobiographical look at the author's internment in one of the Japanese's POW camps, Changi. It is a statement on the ingenuity and cunning of mankind, but also of its brutality. If you're looking for a quick, solid read, this is it."
2,"Much more action oriented than other Clavell work.: Great! Reminded me of The great escape only without the escape. Very moving."
2,"Clavell has done it again. His style expands into the 1900s: This is another fabulous work by James Clavell, a stand-out in his collection. Even though the book was set in a prison camp, all I thought about was that I wanted to be 'The King'. A rivetting story of life and death, friendship and betrayal. Shorter than his other works, but equally valuable."
2,"A significant change from Noble House Saga: A very good read, this novel is more ""complex"" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering ""what the point was the novel trying to get across?"" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it."
1,"Not all that profound after all: I had read this book over 30 years ago as a teenager and thought it would be interesting to see how I reacted to it now. It's a fun and easy read, I'll admit that. But I can see why I liked it more as a 14-year-old; the book seems to have been written by a 14-year-old. And the ""moral dilemmas"" are of the kind you probably dealt with when you first learned what a ""moral dilemma"" is.And although the copy I read was a paperback from the early 1980's that was in its umpteenth printing, it had a surprising number of typos and major grammatical errors. I guess even back then no one took the book too seriously."
1,"Disapointing: After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )"
1,"Reads like a book for 8 to 12 year olds: I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying ""The Brothers Karamazov"". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"
1,"Couldn't get into it.: I'd heard such good things about this book, and couldn't wait to read it. Unfortunately, I found it really slow. I read the paperback version, and to be honest, I couldn't bring myself to finish the book. Major disappointment."
1,"king rat: the book is ok but I am very dissapointed in the condition of the book as I am reading it it is falling apart from the binding and it was listed as good condition but in my opion it was in poor condition water stains yellowing pages and binding is falling apart for the price I paid I expected better quality I doubt that I will purchase thru this group ever again Sharyl"
2,"A great study of the human psyche: Circa 1962 Clavell astounds the reader with his insight to the human condition. From the beginning until the end, King Rat never ceases to surprise and evoke the dark humor concurrent withthe grim reality of terrible circumstances. I remember seeing this book in countless rucks during Viet Nam, read and re-read, taped together, dog eared and in heavily stressed condition then, passed along."
2,"An unforgettable journey!: In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart."
2,"Great Book and Series: Great Book and Series. This was the 3rd time through the Series. Just wish they had the Last and Final book in the Series which was ""Whirlwind"" when I was ready for it."
2,"Great book if you are into WWII history of the Pacific: After living in Singapore for seven years, I read a lot on the war in the pacific.This is one of my favorites. Though fictional, it captured what I saw and read about the Japanese occupation.Clavel is the one of the best."
2,"Outstanding!: If the human condition under extraordinary circumstances interests you, then this book is a must. It's kind of a non-sequitur in the context of the whole Asian saga, but I found it to be absolutely captivating, and a couple of the main characters make a later appearance in Noble House."
2,"Really liked the book: When I first read the book a lot of years ago, i loved it and thought it should have been made in to a movie It's been at least 30 years since I first read it. I enjoyed it so much"
1,"Disappointing: This is the 4th Clavell book I've read, I was more than a little disappointed. I've read them in order so far, Shogun and Tai-pan for me were breathtaking, long books which I sped through. Gai-jin was more of a chore, with not much of ending. I found King Rat dull, I think the story wasn't too interesting. Other customers have commented on how harsh the prison was - too be honest, I thought it would've been worse. The King had none of the charisma of the heroes in the other books, and I found myself not really caring whether or not either him or Marlowe made it. Although a lot was made of their inner feelings, this made me feel that they were both just shallow people."
1,"below par: after reading all of clavell's books, i was looking forward to King Rat. It made me uneasy. I was left with a very disatisfied feeling. Who rated this book so high? were they relatives?I do not recommend it."
2,"Quick, interesting, and accurate: This is different from the ""Asian Saga"" books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point. Clavell was in a POW camp so I get the sense that it is accurate, that it lauds real people through their character portrayals (indirectly), and it scathes other people in the same way."
1,"Numbers Peg puzzle: This number peg puzzle is not for a 2 year old! You cannot tell the nine from the six and depending on your child's age he/she might be confused with the colors of the pegs to the colors on the background."
2,"My son loves it!: My son learned his numbers so quickly with the help of this puzzle. He loves all of the Melissa and Doug chunky puzzles and I figured this would be great to help him learn his numbers. I was right! Great present! Highly recommended!"
2,"Great buy!: You cant go wrong with these puzzles! My son loves to play with them and discover whats under the puzzle pieces. It helps a child develop number recognition which is so important. Very well made and durable! SOmething I will surely save for the next generation."
2,"Colorful, durable AND educational!: I bought this for my great nephew - 18 months old who is already learning to count and learn his colors. I also got him a dino puzzle by Melissa & Doug. Both items are really great. They are very durable and colorful so he likes playing with them and putting the shapes back in their places. The number puzzle is fun because when you take the number out, there are pictures under each number for example - take out the three - there are three turtles (I may have the wrong animal but you get the gist!!). His 3 year old cousin that visits often also loves playing with them so they have a good age range."
2,"cute: My 2 year old daughter really enjoys this puzzle. Perfect for learning numbers and counting. I would recommend for anyone with a toddler. Not so much for babies as I have found they end up chewing a ruining the pieces..."
2,"Best ""Toy"" Ever!: My 16 month old has been playing with this off and on for about a month, and she can now put every single number in the correct place every time without a second of hesitation! Because the numbers are written below each space, she now even recognizes the WORD for each number! Am I ordering the alphabet puzzle immediately."
2,"Numbers Puzzle: I bought this puzzle for my son because we can't afford day care prices and need some things to work with him at home on the basics like ABC's, Numbers, Colors and Shapes. I have nearly every educational puzzle that Melissa and Doug have put out and I love them all."
2,"I love these puzzles.: My almost 2yr old learned her numbers with this puzzle. It's wonderful and easy for little fingers. This is definately not a cheaply made puzzle."
2,"Not appropriate for 16 month old - see update: The pegs and the pictures do not match at all. So, the child has to count the objects in the space of the number and then find the corresponding number. Notice in the picture that they are not even the same color. So if your child does not recognize numbers yet then this puzzle will not work. I know the manufacturer recommends 24 month age but my son is doing other 24 month puzzles already. I'm sure it will be challenging in a few months as he approaches 2 years of age and/or he learns to count. The 6 and the 9 are similar but not interchangeble.update: I stand corrected! My almost 18 month is doing this puzzle and loves it. I do not give enough credit to the clever little brains. He can see the shape and match the shape to the puzzle piece. Amazing. They just seemed so similar to me but I was wrong. 5 star puzzle. . . ."
2,"GREAT NUMBER BOARD: Our son plays with this board while I'm feeding him. He's only 20 months, but using this board is helping us introduce the numbers to him. It's well built. Arrived in only a couple days. Our son loves it!!"
1,"Not water resistant -- one spill ruined the look: 1. The 6 and 9 pieces are interchangeable...that led to some confusion.2. I want this same puzzle with no glossy paper glued on. The remains of a drink were spilled onto it and the paper is now peeling off and it also absorbed the stainThe whole reason I buy wooden toys is for durability -- this same toy with just a stained/painted/plain wood would be perfect"
2,"Excellent for my students: I teach mentally handicapped adults at a local community college, and if you want durable puzzles that your students can use over and over again, I strongly recommend getting puzzles like this. It's durable and can get students to focus their attention. Worth getting."
2,"Great Teaching Tool: This is a great puzzle to have in a childcare center , the children love working with the different numbers"
2,"purchased for 2 yr. old: I purchased several puzzles from Melissa & Doug. They are beautifully made. I would recommend them. These will last a good, long time."
2,"5 FOR ESTATE, 3 FOR THE REST: IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 1 STAR REVIEW, I AM THE ONE THAT LEFT A COMMENT IN FAVOR, BUT WONDERING WHY THEY LEFT ONLY ONE STAR. IT HAD TO BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE SHE GAVE IT A ""HAUNTING"" REVIEW, IF NOT TOO SHORT. THE TUNE: 'ESTATE' IS WITH OUT A DOUBT A FIVE STAR TUNE. IN FACT, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JAZZ VOCAL NUMBERS I CAN REMEMBER HEARING. HOWEVER, THE REST OF THE CD, I FEEL FALLS FAR SHORT OF ESTATE. ALL OF THE MUSIC IS SOFT AND NICE, BUT JUST DIDN'T GRAB ME PERSONALLY. REGARDLESS, YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY. IF NOTHING ELSE, IT WOULD BE NICE QUIET BACKGROUND FOR DINNER OR SLOW AND ALONE DANCING WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE."
1,"Summer-Estate: Anyone who hears this song and isn't mesmerized, then haunted, is deaf. I heard it in my car and almost wrecked. The most beautiful!"
1,"Question: Why does it look as though the same person wrote all seven of the reviews above? Kind of odd, huh?"
1,"A waste of time: This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."
1,"Amazon needs to sort out Weinstock and Huneker: This book is listed with Weinstock as the author, but Huneker is the author. Weinstock wrote the forward. He also wrote a book called ""Chopin: The Man And His Music"". Weinstock should not even be listed as a secondary author, much less the primary author."
1,"Not what expected: As a Noni user for many years, when my preferred vendor had some delivery delays ordered this brand of Noni. When it arrived was disappointed to see not PURE Noni juice, but rather adulterated Noni with fruit juice. I use NONI not for the taste, but the health benefits, yes NONI tastes bad, but I want the benefit of the NONI not additives to make it taste better. Can't recommend this product."
2,"Simple, clear and solidly dogmatic: This is a traditional Catholic study guide book of the Mass of the Angels.The book, though primarily for teachers and suchlike, might very well today do as a text book. Because so much has been lost or is just not taught anymore. It is so well written, and so full of quiet inspiration that a good deal of it could be used for reading aloud in church on suitable occasions.Altogether - quite a find!"
2,"Pure genius!: This is the one of the few books of poetry I've read that actually means something! Discovering this has really changed the way I think about verse and books in general. The best thing about it? NOT boring. I'm so sick of the innocuous, adjectival, over-written, meaningless poems in so many journals and ""literary"" magazines of our time. David Trinidad is smart--read for pure pleasure, and then read again and look for the subtle tricks and talent he employs to make these poems truly great art! Truly fresh, too. No one else is writing about our tarnished culture like Trinidad. He is truly unique, and like I said, the best compliment I can give is that this book is not a bore--something that 98% of all books of poetry these days are! Thank you Mr. Trinidad! You've got me reading and enjoying poetry again!"
2,"If you like Douglass, you'll like this: Good stuff from the great freedom fighter. Rarely known texts are included with the famous ""Narrative."" ""The Condition of the Freedmen"", a look at African-Americans 20 years after the end of slavery, provide some sobering thoughts for American Blacks today. ""The Heroic Slave"" tells the little-known true story of Madison Washington, who led a slave ship called ""The Creole"" into freedom in 1841. I would also recommend ""The frederick Doulgass Reader"" and ""The Life and Times of Frederick Doulgass"" to make your ""Dougology"" complete!"
1,"Frontin': Who gave this guy a music contract? This song is so terrible and overplayed. Plus the guy can't sing he sounds like he is whining. Stay away from this song!!"
2,"MAD HOT FRIED BLOCK PARTY-TYPE MUSIC: THIS BE HOT! NOBODY CAN TOUCH PHARRELL! THIS BE HOT! I'VE ONLY HEARD ""FRONTIN'"" THOW. AIN'T NO THING! WHOOP WHOOP!"
1,"It's not the greatest song: I love the neptunes and almost everything done by them has struck me as gold, but this song is not that great. Pharrell can sing ok, but the beats is their forte. And this beat is nothing special at all. Just didn't do it for me. Also, they added the radio edit of Hott (cot) damn. The clean version of that track is stupid. Better off just listen to the real version on Lord Willin'. Not the best cd single compilation."
1,"The Return of Randy Watson:""Sexual Chocolate"": I'll give the Neptunes Props for being Successful in a very tough Business to make a mark in&they have been doing well for some time now.but as far as Pharell thinking He is the 2nd-Coming of Curtis Mayfield? NAW!Double NAW!!!! Pharell has Radny Watson written all over Him Vocally to me.whenever I watch Pharell up there singing I have a ""Coming to America"" Flashback.but the scary part is that alot of folks are taking His Singing Career as legit."
2,"great insights into a world that few ever see: fantastic investigative reporting with compelling analysis. as easy to read as a good spy thriller and as informative as a good textbook. valuable reading for anyone interested in Japanese finance and the relationship between bureaucrats, politicians, and business.read the first chapter on amazon.com and you'll be hooked."
1,"no product: I am unable to review this product as the item NEVER arrived and I ended up with a refund.Will be looking for another source, and trying to order it again.If and when I finally do get the item I will let you know what I think about it then."
2,"Best introduction to its subject that I know of: When one is trying to get a basic overall grasp of Greek mythology, it can be an overwhelming and formidable subject, and one can be at a loss for the best place to start. Most books I've found either give too much detail too fast or else are hit-and-miss selections that don't give a very comprehensive introduction. If that's been your experience too, this book could be an excellent solution to your problem. It gives a highly readable thorough introduction without overwhelming you with details. As an introduction to or review of Greek mythology, it is therefore highly recommendable. Although probably aimed primarily at children, I suppose grown-ups too, if not already expert on the subject, won't find it too elementary."
2,"A great book~: This book has great myths. At first, it seems boring, but soon your eyes will be glued onto the pages. It is a wonderful book to share around to your classmates and teachers. Each story has a morel that teaches you well on a situation. I recommend this to people around the teens."
2,"Informational: This book is a great resource book. Not only for young readers but for anyone who want to know the most significant stories in Greek Mythology. This book makes a good basic reference for any history class. Anyone can learn easily from this book because it is easy to read, yet you receive a lot of information. It also includes colorful illustrations that giulds the reader through.This book includes sections such as: ""Mother Earth and Her Children"", ""The Gods and Foddesses of Mount Olypus"", ""Zuez and the Creation of Mankind"", and ""Triumnphs of the Gods"". It has such stories as: Prometheus and His Gift to Man, Pandora, Echo, Medusa, Jason, Odysseus, and much more.A personal favorite of mine is the story of Jason. One man fell for the love of a youthful princess, and tempted to leave his wife, Medea. Medea spent much of her money and prepared a feast for Jason. The revenge was sweet.... I can't tell you the rest. Buy this book, its far too interesting."
2,"Great book - a good introduction to Greek mythology: I purchased this book for my 9 year old son as a companion book to several astronomy and constellation guides he requested for his birthday. He completely devoured it in three days - the illustrations are bold and the stories are dramatic/gruesome enough to capture his interest (without being too horrible or nightmare-inducing). We are finding that knowing a bit about the legends behind the constellations makes stargazing that much more enjoyable. I would recommend this book for boys and girls 8-10 years old, although I admit I enjoyed reading it, too!"
2,"Children like this book: My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of ""read it again!""I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."
2,"A early favorite: Greek Gods and Heroes is one of the better books on mythology for children out thare, with great pictures and easy to understand stories that people of all ages can enjoy. As a child it was my favorite book in the school library and I checked it out over and over again. It is a must have for any fan of the greek gods and the myths about them."
1,"Incorrect and Misleading: Attention! Sheldon's views of Jefferson's thought to not reflect on Jefferson's! I could not believe what I was reading when I opened up this book. I hought that Sheldon had at least a relatively firm grasp on Jefferson's thought after reading his book ""The Political Philosophy of Thomas Jefferson,"" I was sorely disappointed. It appears that Sheldon may understand what he thought, but is not able to translate it to the events of today. It is a shame that Sheldon failed in his effort, because such a work as this, properly done, would be wonderful to see. If you truly interested in what Jefferson would think about current events today, let me sum it up for you. He would be outraged and saddened to see what happened to the once great nation that he helped to found. He would be enraged at the tyrannical activities of our government. As for his political leanings, he would most certainly be a radical libertarian."
1,"POOR QUALITY: THESE CLIPPERS FELL APART WITHEN TWO WEEKS.I'VE NEVER SEEN SUCH POORLY MADE CLIPPERS.DO NOT BUY.THE PART HOLDING IT ALL TOGETHER FELL OUT WHILE USEING IT."
1,"Disappointed !: As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item. The interview disc is poor quality and was basically audio from existing early interviews which most fans would have already. The content is dated and is pre reunion.The book has some nice pictures which again, are all pre 'comeback'I would'nt really recommend the item to existing fans, there is'nt really any content of interest. The cover card was scraped on arrival and looked shabby despite having been well packaged."
2,"Second 510 purchased in two years; both are excellent: I bought my first Xerox DocuMate 510 in mid-2008. It works so well that when I wanted to replace an aging scanner for another office machine, I simply bought it again. I am running Win XP (paid extra not to get VISTA when I bought new machines) and find this scanner, combined with PaperPort 11, works beautifully. I do not use the ""single touch"" software that comes with it, having long since learned to use PaperPort for all scanning, so I cannot comment on its functionality. The machine itself does everything it saws, without error."
1,"Very Frustrating Piece of Office Equipment: I have had the displeasure of working with this machine for over 4 years. Its incompetent feeder is only matched by the uselessness of the software it comes with. Save yourself the frustration and buy another scanner."
1,"ripped-off by seller: American Electronics Mart sold me a ""refurbished"" Xerox documate 510 scanner that did not work from the start. I spent two weeks trying to troubleshoot to find out whether the problem was on my end. Then, because I missed the return deadline, they would not take the scanner back. They would not agree to pay the costs to me to ship the scanner back to them. Now, I have wasted $250 on a worthless piece of junk sold to me by these crooks. Don't ever buy anything from these creeps."
1,"DocuMate 510 is Horrible: This scanner is absolutely terrible. I have a small home business and I want to go paperless. If you are in the middle of a scan job, say you are on the 30th page already, and something is wrong, there is no recovery feature so you have to start from scratch. In fact, tech support says you will get constant errors if you scan more than 20 pages at a time, yet the document feeder is supposed to hold 50 pages (?). You can scan and then merge multiple scans to become one, but that is not the point. The point is that out of 900 pages of scanning, i got about two dozen errors which requires me to shut off the machine, close the scanning program and start all over again. I returned the product and got another documate 510 because tech support said it must be faulty, but the second is exactly the same. This scanner is nothing but a pain in the rear. I am shipping the second one back in the morning."
1,"ALL images are titled left: I have tried several permutations and combinations with this scanner. Here are some of the observations:1) Image resolution is too bad for the file size it produces. I used an EPSON scanner before, and could get a much better B&W; and color resolutions for a much shorter file size2) All the images are titled towards one side. So, if you are scanning photographs, this is not the right scanner. A part of the picture will always need to be cut out if you try to straighten it up!3) When trying to get a reasonable B&W; resolution (300 dpi), scan speed is not as great as advertised.Overall, I don't think this scanner is worth its price."
1,"JUNK - don't waste your money or time!: My company bought this scanner about a year and a half ago. We have 10 - 15 people who use it intermittently. It does not see heavy use. From the beginning we've had trouble with it jamming and feeding multiple pages. The cover to open it is very hard to snap open, and it won't recover from a jam without us turning off the scanner and rebooting the computer. I discovered that if I change the automatic document feeder pad assembly every 3 months or so, which I should not have to do, it helps the jamming and misfeed issue. Recently I went to order these pads, which were $20.00 apiece, and I couldn't find them on Xerox's website. When I called them they said this item was no longer being sold individually, but in a kit with cleaning solution and 2 pads. So what would have cost $40.00 - bad enough - now costs $100.00 !! As if we haven't spent enough money and frustration on this thing. I am going to do my best to get rid of this thing and buy one that works!"
1,"worked well, but now driver issues: This scanner worked fine for me for a year, and now with later windows 2000 service patches, it has what appears to be USB problems. I've tried the latest driver available on several machines, and if they have windows 2000 with the newest patches, it will only work once or twice, then there is a driver error. I can do the normal windows recovery technicques of uninstalling & reinstalling, rebooting, trying different USB ports, etc. but short of re-imaging the machine, it won't recover. I am using this scanner with Adobe Acrobat 6 Pro with the latest service patches. I've researched and not found a new driver for this device for quite some time. Going to try to hack on a visioneer driver after reading some of the other reviews here."
1,"Not great, but not bad: Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level."
1,"Good scanner - poor software: Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."
1,"Stinks jams all the time: Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages. I basically have to sit here and babysit the scanner the whole time. I could scan my documents faster one page at a time on a regular scanner. Returning it as we speak."
1,"Compatible ONLY with their software: Bad Scanner. Only with their software are you able to scan in paperwork. Paperport causes more problems with the computers I have it installed on than any other product I know of. If you have anything greater than Adobe Acrobat 5 installed, you can't use Acrobat to scan in software. Stay away from the Documate line of scanners!"
1,"worst scanner ever: I bought this scanner to scan approximately 100,000 pages of literature and it is just horrible. I returned it after a few weeks and got the fujitsu scansnap scanner. The fujitsu scansnap is simply the best non-commercial adf scanner on the planet, and I recommend you take a look at it (search for scansnap at amazon)."
2,"Love Die Happy!: Just to beware, this single does not have a B side to it. Just a remix of the Big Boy song, but still, I love Die Happy, so."
2,"intersting: This book has opend up my eyes. Robert Frost is in my mind one of the best potes in the world."
2,"Educational toy: This is a very effective toy. After rolling a few 7's or 11's it becomes obvious that even a cursory examination will expose cheating methodology."
2,"Get This Player!: Before I decided to get this player, I did my research. I looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player. I chose this one because from what I read, it was the best deal for the money. Another reason I got it is because you can put WMA files on it. That takes up half the space of MP3's. That's important because I have a lot of music. The software is great. you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories. transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy. even the battery life is great- it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good. only 1 problem, no accessories...yet. I hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard. They player's interface itself is also very easy to use. can't complain and I recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon. GET IT, IT'S WOTH EVERY PENNY!!"
1,"Not as advertised: My Nomad Jukebox Zen Xtra 40GB only worked for 6 months. I no longer have any sound and the battery doesn't charge. When I called customer service I was given the excuse that it wasn't supposed to be used in the gym. As you all know it is marketed to fulfill your portable music needs. If you can't use it in the gym then it is not truly portable. I know many people who use their ipods in the gym and have had no problems for years. This product has fallen far below my expectations. It is not worth the $300, not to mention the fact that it only has a 90 day warranty. Can you trust a product that is only guaranteed to work for 3 months? No."
1,"Good for a little while, but....: Sure, this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an iPod. But with a low price, comes lower quality. Our special friends at Creative gave this thing good sound quality, great features, long battery life, and an unbeatable price. The catch is it's built like a piece of crap. It lasted about 1 1/2 weeks. I didn't abuse it, I charged it every day, but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out. I tried re-setting it, I tried just about every pair of headphones in my house (10 pairs), and nothing worked. So I contacted customer service at Creative, but they said, ""If the product seems broken, we cannot help,"" or something to that effect. Wow. Don't get me wrong, the thing was like heaven for about a week. If you want a quality mp3 player, splurge on an ipod. If you really need to save, buy this thing on Amazon, they eventually gave me a full refund. I bought myself an RCA mp3-cd player, and I'm happy with that until a cheap, worthwhile mp3 player coomes out."
2,"**Great player, but but for newbies**: I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies. But if you want great control and organization over your MP3s, this is definitely the player for you!!!"
2,"Zen: I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. I can drag and drop songs with the nomad explorer. I can listen to it for 15hrs at a time before it needs a recharge and it holds my whole collection of cds.There are however a few cons to this product.The plastic clip that comes on the carring case snaped so I replaced it with a nylon strap I sewed onto the back of the case and havn't had a problem since.There are two things that could really improve this product, a line out and a fm transmiter to use to play in cars that have only a cd player.This is an awsome mp3 player and well worth the money."
2,"Good Unit: I've already dropped it, (unit was off) and it's fine. It's a little larger than I expected, so is more of a pocket unit than an armband or clip-on. The creative software is not too good - I did some searching and found some recommendations for Notmad Explorer - which does truly rock as accessory software for the Nomad. It will copy over playlists from most other media players without a hitch- which was problematic with the Creative application. Overall I'm pleased with the purchase."
1,"First and Last: This product is the the first Mp3 Player that I bought and it has turned me off from buying anything from creative again. As others have mentioned the headphone jack breaks quite easily, but not from rough use, it just breaks down. I barely had this thing a month before it started giving problems, and I only used it to go from home to work. This I guess is why people flock to the Ipod, cause you may not be able to replace the battery but it is damn sturdy. This is just a piece of junk"
1,"lacking file format support is not for me: this player supports ONLY mp3 and wmaunfortunately, my own-made music format is ogg, and downloaded radio recording is asf format, this player don't support bothand lack of digital recording is a major drawback too, unlike iriver, it has digital in and out, this is a necessary for mesorry, zen, this is not for me"
1,"What's with the low sound?: I bought the Zen Xtra 40Gb yesterday, taking it back today. The sound is awful. The volume range goes up to a 25, and even with the EAX or whatever it's called on, it's barely audible. I don't know if it's the jack gone like you all say or if this is just designed for easy listening. No good for loud music. Prepare to listen to background noise, not your music. This thing sucks. Don't buy it."
1,"BASIC DESIGN FLAW: Forget how this unit works because it has a basic design flaw that will drive users crazy! The front cover has a release button that allows removal of the front cover to access the removable battery. Forget about the release button. You don't need it. just tap the lower left hand corner of the case and the cover pops open! Convenient, huh? No way! This design flaw is a total pain in the ass! And it's not just my unit. I tested two other new, out of the box units and both did the same thing. Simply bad design and no quality testing. Do yourself a favor and avoid this unit at all costs unless you don't mind continually closing the case after it has popped open on it's own."
1,"Headphone Jack Problems: The headphone jack on my Zen Xtra stopped working day 40 (1st day on a 7-day cruise, no less!) While Creative did replace the unit, why haven't they recalled all Zen's?This is my second Nomad -- I had a Nomad 2.0 20GB, but it's screen stopped working. Creative refused to repair unless I paid $105, so (silly me) I bought a new unit instead.Never again, Creative!"
1,"A Possible Discontinued Item?: What's going on Creative Labs? Is it a coincidence that I no longer can get any of your Nomad Zen Xtras (worst name ever) at Best Buy and now the 60GB Nomad Xtra is ""sold out"" or more likely ""discontinued"" at the almighty Amazon.com? hmmmmm...."
2,"Great MP3 player: Where to start I have had this for 10 years and it is still ticking that alone is a tesament to how well the thing works. Over that ten years It has traveled with me to over a third of the world. This is to include half a tour in Iraq. It has been dropped and has been trough airport security more times than most people. Because of this I have never had a reason to buy an Ipod. And to be honest for music I would rather use this. Only reason that I own anything like an Ipod is that its my Iphone. So I think that the Xtra is by far the one of the best mp3 player made."
1,"Headphone jack: I got the 40gb jukebox zen xtra for christmas. So, I've had it for a month, and the headphone jack went out. I called creative and they said to send it in and they would decide if it in warranty. It'll take 10-15 business days for them to decide form when they get it. Nothing but hassle with this company. What kind of product goes out within a month?"
1,"Steer clear of all Creative MP3 players: I love my Zen Xtra 40GB - well at least I loved my Xtra. The player is great, except for one major detail - the shoddy quality of the headphone jack. IT WILL FAIL! If you get lucky it will still be under warranty. If you aren't expect to pay at least $40 for the clowns at Creative to fix it. If you think I am just flaming them, check out their forums."
2,"Solid Player without the ""iPod Mystique"": I purchased this player over 4 months ago. I read all of the reviews and I was aware of the pros and cons going in. This player is slightly thicker than the same capacity ipod. On the upside, the battery is user upgradeable, which iPod users can't do. The main downside to this player is the software. I highly recommend NotMad Explorer from http://www.redchairsoftware.com as a replacement for the poor Creative software. The upsides are great sound quality, great capacity, decent battery life and a good price. If you don't care about looking trendy carrying an iPod, take a good hard look at the Creative Nomad Zen players."
2,"Doing the job for less money!!!!: If you want space to carry your music everywhere...this is your device. For all those reviews about the cover, now the cover included with the player has window to the screen, no need to take the player out of the case, unless you are changing the battery. A USB cable is included...no extra purchase. And the fact that you can copy the music back to your computer is a plus for me. The buttons takes a little getting use to it, but for almost $200 less, I can deal with it. The software is easy to learn, and the fact that you can replace the battery with ease...big plus..."
1,"Not a fan: I took my zen back after a week of problems.It's really fussy about id3 tags, which is a problem if some of you collection didn't come _directly_ off cd. I fiddled around with various automated taggers, but never got things working to satisfaction. The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20+ minutes rebuilding it's database of tracks after a crash (i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags).Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out, as it has for many other reviewers. That was the last straw. I'm over it, thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all."
1,"THIS PLAYER IS TRASH !: The price looks good do not be fooled.Mine also worked ok for the first 6 months reguardless that the software would not transfer a portion of my music. The death of this unit was when I had fixed the ID3 tages to get all my music to be able to be tranfered to the player , I removed the music library and then reloaded the repaired lib at this point the player will not play anything corectly. parts of tracks play and parts are garbled.This is true when playing over headphone jack usb to pc will still play normal. This is not the same problem as the phone jack breaking like happens to 2/3 of the players."
1,"Phone Jack Faulty: I loved this thing until 2 1/2 months after purchase... The phone jack is not working properly. Now I am very disappointed. Glad I got a 2 year replacement plan from Best Buy. Recommend you protect yourself if you buy this product. I don't think the phone jack problem is a rare one from what I have read here."
2,"Good for the price: I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day."
2,"What a great toy!: I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary."
1,"breaks easily and has bad warrenty: the warrenty on this device is only 3 months and it breaks quite quickly. the cover kept popping off and when it broke creative said the warrenty ran out"
1,"What a junk: What a junk. Every time NOMAD thinks the file is corrupt the OS freezes. The only way to recover is to plug the power cord and go into recovery mode. So if you happen to be out of the house and you have a frozen OS you can't use NOMAD until you get home. After OS froze twice on me in the subway I returned the jukebox."
1,"Why can't it be rated ZERO stars?: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT--I took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended. Nearly 4000 songs went up in smoke. The software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other SOUND BLASTER products, which is very dumb."
2,"Nice portable, small GPS receiver!: I have had this unit and used it for a couple of years now. the reason that I bought it was its portability and I could use it both in the car or have it with me when I am walking. So, from that aspect, it is very nice. now every positive normally comes with a few negatives. as you may guess, due to the size of this unit, the receiver is probably not the most powerful or accurate receiver, so you need to learn how to cope with these aspects of it. I have had cases where the receiver got confused when I was in the city (San Francisco) with a couple of tall buildings around or when I was driving around on windy roads in Sierra. But other than that it has worked fine for me and I have used it in town and country. I found another navigation SW for it that I think is nicer and performs better than the one that came with it from HP. (...) mine is an MMCX."
1,"Junk!! Yosemite is not POI according Navteq: Can you imagine.?? when I tried to find points of Interest near Yosemite. It said No POI found ..Garmin has Mapsource that is far better than Navteq.It has the options to create automatic, point-to-point routes on your PC without need of a GPS so that you can create multiple waypoints, routes before your transfer it to your device."
1,"Angel Baby: I ordered this video and it took nearly a month to arrive because it was being shipped from England. Once I received it, it wouldn't play - at all. I have had two friends try it on their DVD just to make sure mine wasn't the problem and it didn't work on theirs either. Because it was shipped from Europe, do you think it could only be compatible with European DVD's? I got it for my elderly uncle who plays a cameo role in the film and we were so disappointed that it didn't work.Is there a way to get my money back, or get an exchange?"
2,"Perfect for Every Fisherman: Beautiful and very helpful book for both the experienced and novice fishermen. Great pictures really make the book user friendly. Would make a great gift."
1,"disappointed: I can't share the enthusiasm of my preceeding reviewers.In my opinion, this is a book for advanced fishermen, who already know about fisheries ethics, or don't care about it. The book doesn't cover important aspects such as selective harvesting (how to keep damage on fish as low as possible so it can be released again) or treatment of fish, once it's caught (swift killing, keeping, cleaning).Two thirds of the book are about baiting, with major chaptors on how to use life bait such as small fish, salamander, frogs. However, the author completely fails to address ethical concerns about this technique(""replace your bait frequently. When a frog tires and stops kicking, it is much less effective""), a technique that is actually forbidden in some countries because of the cruelty involved."
1,"This is rubbish: If you're a Heaven 17 fan, you're gonna be disappointed; if you like good techno, you're gonna be disappointed. It's just plain rubbish. There are one or two tracks that *might* warrant a second listening, but overall, the CD is annoying and a waste of money. Most of tracks have very little unity between H17 and the dance track, sounding like two songs mistakenly played together."
2,"Welcome to da marketplace!: This 1985 album by Bunny Wailer is by no means, his best work. That honor goes to ""Blackheart Man"". But ""Marketplace"" does contain some fine pop-reggae tunes such as Stay With The Reggae, Electric City, and Jump Jump. Plus the album cover is great! I recommened picking this up if you can find a copy."
2,"Lost innocense, found hope and heartbreak: This is a book that will tug at your heartstrings. I found myself turning the pages feeling the authors pain, joy and sadness.This is a unique style of writing, and maybe it would have worked well for a novel, but the author told it the way he felt it, and the poetry works in conveying what he wanted to say! I recommend it to anyone that has been in a similiar situation and hope that it can help then understand what they have been through, and maybe help them resolve their past.The only down side to the book is that I would have liked to read more. There are only 97 pages of actual poetry, and the author's own words, which I found to be very profound. Maybe the author's next book will be longer. I look forward to reading more of his work."
2,"La mejor pel�_cula de Moore: A mi juicio, esta es la mejor comedia de Dudley Moore.El reparto es excelente.Realmente la recomiendo."
1,"Software doesn't work!: I am very computer literate. The software provided is not for use with the product. I tried to download drivers so my computer could recognize the camera but had no luck. There are other identical mini cameras like this one packaged under different names. Don't buy this one."
1,"Ida B. Wells: Woman of Courage: I was very eager to see a video of this outstanding woman, but I was very unhappy with the product. Dull. Two other items included on the video, but the part about Wells consisted of a person reading from a book. Get the book biography instead of this product--a waste of money."
2,"THE BEST SALSA: THE BEST SAUCE YOU COULD EVER PUT ON YOUR TABLE AND USE ON YOUR COOKING ON JUST ABOUT ANYTHING, BRINGS THE COSTARICAN SPIRIT ON YOUR MEALS!"
1,"OUTDATED: 1)The problems in the book are very outdated. (for grammar section buy Cliff's or Longman)2)The problems in the book are less difficult than those on a real exam.3)The problems in the book were arranged in very boring manner.4)The CD-Rom is only for Listening. (for more computer practice buy Delta's Key for Toefl Test with CD, which has 10 tests or Cambridge Preparation for Toefl Test, which has 7 tests. Both books have CD-Rom simulated CBT.)5) The Essay section is fair. (for the best essay section buy Cambridge Preparation for the Toefl Test)Generally, there is no one book for the preparation for the TOEFL. Most likely you will need some combination of them.For instance,a) Delta for practice and reading. Moreover, you may wish to buy just Delta CD Rom without book and cassets for practice only;b)Cliff's or Longman for grammar;c)Cambridge for essay and for practice.Good luck!"
2,"Good examples and helpful hints: I bought this book after i failed to get the score i needed in the TOEFL exam, and it helped me a lot at the second time I did the test. The best part about it is the CD-ROM that has 4 complete tests so you can practice just like if you were doing the real Computer Based TOEFL Test. It helps you to get in the mood of the test so you are prepared when you take the real test. There is only one thing that should be enhanced in this book. The review and hints at the ""writing test part"" are not enough. There should be more essay examples. Over all, this is the book you have to buy if you are planning to pay just for one book to prepare for the TOEFL"
1,"CDs DO NOT HAVE SOFTWARE!!!!!: It turns out that this book only comes with Audio cds! Go figure: When the TOELF is mainly take on the CBT form"
2,"This is a perfect review book, but it is not a textbook.: If you know English well and you need only to review some important details, this is the book you need to buy. It covers small rules, which are VERY IMPORTANT for the TOEFL, but it does not tell you much, for example, about sequence of tenses.In other words, this book will help you to improve your score, but it can not teach you English if you are a beginner.For me, the most important part of the book was structur review. IT really helped! Listening part shows the same level of difficulty as in the TOEFL, but reading is much easier then on the test. To understand the reading level of difficulty and to practise the test I would recommend TOEFL Test Preparation Kit."
1,"Wrong CD-ROM: When you buy this book (10th edition), do not buy the one with the CD-ROM. It is not the right one (it is the 9th). All the books with CD-ROM have the wrong one. The correct one comes out in October. So if you want to buy this book do NOT take the one with the CR-ROM, because you're going to waste money!!"
2,"Second-best resource: This book is the second-best book on TOEFL after Educational Testing Services' (ETS) TOEFL book."
1,"CD Was missing: I dont find any CD inside the book. It was really matter of disgrace that CD was missing after shifting. While I was going for the purchase it was mentioned that the CD will be available but it was missing"
2,"In general, a good book: I took the Toefl test this morning and I have to say that this book was very useful. I haven't received the official grades yet but my note should be between 215 and 265, and given the fact that I've just studied two hours a day for one month...Definitely this book helped me a lot to improve my grammar, but I also believe that the examples were organized in a boring fashion. The practice tests for the listening section are really good, about the reading section... my advice to you: READ! READ! READ! No matter how much time you spend on vocabulary, they will find a word you don't know."
1,"Humor about males being incompetent in the birth process: In general, I have little appreciation for humor based on male parental incompetence. Furthermore, ... I have just as little time for humor based on female mechanical incompetence. The theme of this book is male incompetence when it comes to pregnancy and birth. Many of the cartoons are about men being nincompoops in the delivery room, doing such helpful things as fainting, getting sick when looking at the placenta and so forth. ...Some of the cartoons about the baby in the womb are a bit humorous, but overall I did not find this collection of jokes very funny."
1,"Terrible: I couldn't even finish it. I kept reading it thinking, ""What is the point of this story?"" I found it very boring at times and disgusting at others. Definitely one of the worst books I've ever read."
2,"My favorite book - ever!: Vindication is really a treasure - a big red ruby of a novel that penetrates such important history witha raw heart and fierce intelligence. Wow."
1,"Horrible: I'd have given this book Zero stars, if that had been an option. Sherwood's writing style is crude at best, with some of her sentences making little to no sense at all. There writing flows very poorly (if at all), and the metaphors are some of the worst I've seen. The dialogue is boring and simplistic. I also agree with the reviewers that said this book is unnecessarily vulgar in many places. One of the worst books I've read in a long while."
2,"I loved this book: I read several reviews on this book already, and feel that what I have to say about this book has already been said. I loved this book, and found it to be quite the page turner."
2,"Amazing Results: This was recommended to a friend of mine by his doctor. I'm usually very skeptical of herbal treatments, but since the recommendation came from a regular medical doctor, I decided to give it a try. I am blown away by the results. I have been on this product for about 18 months, and my cholesterol has dropped from 252 to 192. I made no other significant changes in my diet. What's more, I am only taking two capsules a day instead of the recommended dosage of four per day. I've read that the big pharmaceuticals are campaigning to require this product to be sold only by prescription. I pray this never happens."
2,"Better than pharmaceutical statins: I cannot tolerate pharmaceutical statins and this product gives me excellent results without side effects, been using it for many years."
1,"What a laugh: This junk really stinks (literally, it smells horrible)!! I've used better products and those other attractants did trigger responses in females. I've been INSULTED by the females at my job after using alter ego and been told things like ""what in the world is that new cologne you're wearing, it doesn't smell good"". I told my wife I was wearing a new type of ""after shave"" and she hates it so much I had to promise NOT to wear it to bed. Don't believe the hype of Alter Ego, there are far far far better Pheromones. It's apparent they tried to give it a MASCULINE tone, but they went too far."
1,"Got the wrong product and no answer on my mail: I ordered Alter Ego for men but got Alter Ego for woman. I followed the procedure given on the the web to complain and ask how to do the return, but did not get any answer."
2,"Simply The Best!: This book dates back to the civil war era. It was the fashion source that women turned to for the most current information on what to wear. If you have ever wondered what they really wore, and why they wore it then I would suggest that you look to these books for the answers. Typically these books have a full year bound together. Each month should have a color fashion plate featuring the current wardrobe fashions. They also have music, poems, short stories, knitting and crochet patterns, health tips and cooking hints. They provide a valuable insight into the era. If you are a civil war reenactor there is no better source for accurate information, and if you are just a fan of American history, these books are an outstanding source."
1,"Case doesn't fit phone properly: The case I had didn't fit properly - the window obstructed the rightmost side of the display. You could shift it over, but it would always shift back. I don't know if they are all that way (maybe I got a bad one?), but I didn't want to buy another one to find out."
1,"Can you hear me now...Can you hear me now?: The averall construction is good but the placement of the holes leave a lot to be desired. It changes position very easily and constantly covers the, already way too small, holes you speak into. I would have been very dissapointed if I would have paid the original asking price of $... The belt clip feature is good."
2,"Good Fit & Function: The cover fits reasonably well, with only slight shifting. It does not obstruct any of the controls, display, the mouthpiece or the earpiece. I really like the clip on the back. I'm pretty satisfied overall."
2,"Helpful Advice for LDS Authors!: I highly recommend this book and would have given it five stars except for the fact that there was a small typo or two in it--not the fault of the authors, who are all excellent writers.Although the book states it's for LDS writers who want to break into the LDS market, the advice given applies to national market publishing in many cases.I purchased this book at the beginning of my writing career, when I knew nothing about how to get my work published, and learned extensively from it. I'd recommend it to anyone who is interested in having his or her work published. The information runs the gamut from how to write query letters to handling rejections. Thanks in part to ""Publising Secrets,"" my co-author, Nichole Giles, and I now have a book of LDS humor that will be released in the fall of 2009. [....]"
2,"Miracle: Okay, this was the last album I purchased after listening to all 4 albums of Evergrey. I have to say this record has something to it, it has a completely different atmosphere. So many songs on this record are so powerful in meaning and in music, listening to them atleast 20 times is not enough at all. Having the preachers voices in the background in a couple of songs defenitely touches souls in some way or other.5 Thumps Up!!!"
2,"Great book, but get the paper version if you can wait: This book looks like such a great resource into veganized 'authentic' italian. Very excited to try some recipes. However, the kindle version is strange and often slightly out of order."
2,"the best cookery book I own!: This is the book to buy for all your vegan and vegetarian friends and family members. It is easy to read and to use... has great recipes and handy hints in a novel layout - and the best part of all is that everything tastes delicious! Some vegan recipes might be healthy but they are not always as tasty as the 'original' Not so with this book! Bryanna's book is filled with recipes ranging from basic cooking instructions to exotic desserts... all yummy and all relatively easy to make.As an added bonus, Bryanna gives lists of mail order resources for sometimes hard to find items - this is especially valuable if you are like me and live in a rural area without easy access to health stores.If you buy just one recipe book this Christmas season, this is the one to get! If I could give it six stars I would!"
2,"My favorite vegan cookbook!: I've been vegan for about 4 years now, and I've been cooking all of my meals for 2 or 3. I've spent over $100 on a shelf full of vegan cookbooks. This one is the best I own. It's the only cookbook I have that has recipes that make food that's outright better than anything I ate before I went vegan! Ever since I started making my own vegan pizzas, I absolutely stopped missing the greasy things that I'd been getting delivered, and the pasta recipes here are the best I've ever had.The only problem with this book is that the recipes can take a while to prepare. If you're not a big fan of cooking, this probably isn't the book for you. But if you're glad to spend an hour in the kitchen making a meal and want to have some great vegan food, this book is a must!"
2,"Best of the series: A first rate beautifull compilation, with every selection a winner. One of my personal favorties. Great music and great soundinf too. Ella's ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most"" was for me, a revelation. All artists best work."
1,"Horrible.: I have had the first DVD since I bought my first dance hoop over a year ago, and figured that I would give the second one a try. This DVD is horrible! The picture and sound quality sucks. The picture is grainy and the sound is off. I could have made a better DVD in my backyard with my small camera. It is over-priced and they could have fit so much more in one DVD. I am so dissapointed that Hoopnotica would put out such a low quality product."
1,"Cheap!: I haven't been able to watch this much because the DVD won't play in my normal (otherwise functioning) DVD player. It will play on my computer's DVD player, but without sound. The DVD will play fine on my laptop, but that's not a screen that's very conducive to practicing in front of. The DVD does play on my friend's DVD player for some reason. Also, I bought volumes 1 and 2 and both are so short, it seems obvious that they could have put all of the lessons on one DVD. I guess they knew they could make more money by making us buy both."
2,"Good instruction: As mentioned in other reviews the actual quality of the video's visuals is not so great but I didn't find that in any way a problem as the content was great. All the basic moves are covered and broken down in a helpful way and each includes several tips for why you may not be getting a specific move and what to try to correct it.I got the video for the trick instruction but also really enjoyed the work out section. Will definitely be trying some of the higher level videos next."
2,"A book about finding yourself: Wonderful book that I discovered in junior high. Several years later I bought a copy and this novel has become one of a treasured few I read again every year. The central character (indeed, practically the only character for most of the book) grows so much during her experience that you remember her life changes long after you put down the book. As always, great fast-moving, realistic storytelling from Harry Mazer."
1,"An enormous disappointment: As a fan of both Costello and Frisell, I was pleased to see this record come out - it's been a long tradition in jazz to play around with pop songs, and I thought it was an exceptional idea to choose them from this great Costello/Bacharach album.The result is terrible, however. Yeah, everyone is playing the notes very nicely, but these are merely rote and exceedingly pallid, mainly instrumental verions of the originals, which on the first album are full of much more passion and spontaneity. There is no imagination or inspiration here, no sense of even an attempt to make the music their own. It seems inexplicable that no one involved in this project could hear how dull and lifeless it was. And on a personal level, Billy Drewes is a taste I perhaps will never acquire. Don't waste your money, this is an awful record."
1,"all-round disappointment: I'm a big fan of Costello, a big fan of Bacharach, and through Deep Dead Blue, became a fan of Frisell. This combination seemed too good to be true, and actually, I was so looking forward to hearing it as one piece that I saved listening to it until I had a long car journey.Sadly, the Sweetest Punch is much less than the sum of the parts.I understand that Bill recorded it without hearing Elvis & Burt's finished album. I wish he'd waited and used it as inspiration, as The Sweetest Punch is neither sweet nor punchy. Instead it is passionless, routine and flat. Moreover it's just dull if you compare it to the rich, elegant, touching soundscapes of Painted From Memory.I am surprised that as someone with so much creative control over his output, Elvis didn't take Bill aside and suggest re-mixing or re-recording or simply not releasing.Sad really."
1,"Is it just me....or....: Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on ""TOLEDO"".I loved ""Painted From Memory""- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g ""Painted from Memory"", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is ""God Give Me Strength"", which on all other recordings is amazing."
1,"only 1 in the bag: >:I assumed that the 3 items in the picture was what I was buying, not 1, what am gonna do with one?"
2,"My wife loves it: My wife thoroughly enjoyed this DVD, saved me from the fact I did not get her tickets to the concert!"
1,"Extermely dissapointed: I like Tina very much. I was extrememly dissapointed in this DTS version of the DVD. To my ears, the sound quality was plain at best. When I see DTS, I expect something special. I want to be able to say, WOW! It let me down tremendously. Compared to ""Hell Freezes Over"" it ranks about a 2 and that's being generous. It is WAY over priced!I played it once and never had the urge to play it again!"
1,"This Is Not a Live Concert: Bought this DVD on the strength of the tape I had of the same concert broadcast on Showtime in the 90's. Thought the concert should have won a Cable ACE award it was so good. Couldn't wait to see the DVD version and when I heard the first vocals come out I couldn't believe that they had overdubbed new vocals over the originals. What was one of the best concert videos that I had ever seen and heard was ruined by someone who thought he could improve on perfection. Don't waste your money if you've seen the original."
1,"What a Cryin' Shame ....: I love Tina. Her music is the epitome of energizing soul-rock. We looked forward to this DTS version of her concert. We put it in, sat back, and after 5 minutes into the concert I was becoming agitated at what should be a great show. The music was great, but after 30 minutes I was going nuts. Then it dawned on me: the camera work is absolutely the worst. It's horrible. It detracts from the concert. It never stops moving. It never stops fading in & out. It jumps from one angle to another. It changes every few seconds and it never stops for the whole concert. A bunch of high school kids could have done better. I hope we can find another Tina concert worth buying but the Amsterdam concert was a waste of our money. What a cryin' shame."
2,"A great performance: This was a a great performance. Tina is superb as are all her back up musicians. The production is great and the DTS sound is outstanding. You won't go wrong with this one."
2,"Simply The Best Concert!: I wish I could give this more then 5 stars. This concert tour was Tina's best concert. I almost did not buy this because I own this on video. When I recevied it, to my surprise, the DVD has four extra songs on it then the video. The songs are ""Wildest Dreams"" ""Let's Stay Together"" ""Something Beautiful Remains"" and ""Better Be Good To Me"" If anyone caught Tina on this tour, here is your chance to own the ""complete"" concert for ever!"
2,"The best concert video !!!!!: This is the best concert video ever. Great show and great music ! Tina Turner's show still gets better every time she tours ! Now we have it in perfect DVD picture and DTS sound."
2,"Tina Turner concert: LOVE IT , LOVE IT, LOVE IT. I exercise to this DVD, 30-35 minutes at a time. The music is great, Tina of course is great. BEST exercise workout I have ever had and the scenery is FINE, FINE, FINE. Thanks to all who make this DVD possible !!!"
2,"Flawed but interesting fiction on Russian America: I can't help but think this book would have been far better as a non-fiction piece. The characters are not really that absorbing, and I feel that the narrator has much more to say about the experience of kayaking or canoeing the Northwest Coast from Sitka to Oregon than the fiction format allows him to. The description of the sea and land is really amazing and makes it absolutely worth reading. However, I have a bit of sympathy for the reviewer who said it was boring because the plot is not as gripping as a summary would suggest (4 men escape from Novo-Arkhangelsk, now Sitka, in order to eventually return to Sweden). It is a man against nature story, but I suppose I found the nature part much more interesting than the men.A non-fiction reflection retracing this journey interwoven with the author's own thoughts probably would have been much more gripping.Still, it is worth reading nonetheless."
2,"A Page Turner: Ivan Doag has captured my attention. After reading this great adventure story, I intend to order more books written by this author. His ability to create dialogue and tell a fascinating tale is remarkable. My only wish is for a sequel."
2,"Indelible impact: Sea Runners will etch the coastline of British Columbia in your mind. An awesome tale."
1,"big words used for big words sake: I have read other Ivan Doig books and found them immensely interesting but the phrasing and vocabulary in this book were very awkward. The descriptions would have been better if the author had not tried to use big words which made the voice of the book seem pretentious. I read it for a book club and had a hard time getting through it. The sad thing is that the story itself was interesting as were the characters. It was just an awkward book to read. It definitely was not a page turner. I don't think I shall ever read anything else by Doig which is a disappointment after reading others."
1,"this book is SO BORING: sure its a bit funny, and it touches me cause i am a swede, but it seriously is not that good of a book. its just about rough seamean looking out at the BRISK sunrise. big words don't make a book good.i did NOT like this book, but im giving it some sympathy points, which is why it gets 2 stars."
2,"Rough Hewn Poetry: Descriptions of the Pacific Northwest are accurate and beautiful. The rhythm of the book captures the frustration of its characters and makes it part of your life. I felt I was on the sea paddling for seemingly forever. What kind of characters are required to make a superhuman effort? What kind of relationships are developed by disparate humans when pitted against great odds? Doig helps to answer these questions. This is a MUST READER for understanding the Pacific Northwest."
2,"Wild Alaskan adventure: Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!"
1,"Pile of Junk - Save your money!: The first one I received the SD card slot lock did not work. The second one literally took 5 to 10 minutes to boot up. I returned it again to Discount Jungle (Amazon Seller) and they said they would not charge me the 15% restocking fee which they did anyhow.All in all, I wouldn't own another Sandisk MP3 even if they would give me one for free! I'm out $10.00 for two return shipments and another $10.00 restocking fee. Nothing to restock at Discount Jungle, send the piece of junk back to Sandisk!!!Save some headaches and buy something different! Do a Google search for Sansa View slow start up, boot, or lockup.At least the FM Radio was nice....that's why it has a two star rating. I'd sure hate to see how well the re-manufactured units work."
2,"Advice to potential buyers: Just wanted to mention a few things the other reviewers didn't. This player supports the WMA format which iPOD does not. I have the 8GB unit and expanded it with a 4GB MicroSD card. After adding the Micro SD card, the unit took about 90 seconds to start up, and battery life was reduced from 3 hours to about 30 minutes! Overall, I love it as a MP3 player, but would recommend you go with a unit with 16GB built-in storage if you think you'll need that much room."
1,"SanDisk Sansa View Player MP3 Player - plays less than two hours: While advertised as eight hours of play time, the player didn't make a two hour trip once in the three or four weeks we had it.Now just waiting to get the refund we've been notified we will receive so we can try something else, hopefully something that will live up to its advertisement this time."
1,"cheap: After about 3 months things started going down hill really fast. After leaving it in the car on a summer day something went wrong with the with the power saver. I'd charge it over night and the next morning it would be dead. I'd listen to it for 5 minutes, turn it off, then turn it back on and it would be at half power. Recently the screen broke. That just gave me a good reason to get rid of it.Trust me, keep looking."
1,"Overall problematic MP3 player: I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines. The rewind bar doesn't work either! you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease."
1,"not a good experience: I bought a sansa view 8gb from Sold by: txxhenk, and i am not at all satisfied with this product. I just got the player, without a charger, how on the world should i charge this player without a charger. I also didn't receive the USB cable or the head phones or the user manual. I know that this is used-good condition but i didn't expect this."
1,"Wow the battery life is bad!: If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!"
1,"Think twice about buying this player !: I purchased this player last August and it worked fine for 4 months, even though I didn't play it much. My intent was to use it primarily on plane flights. Suddenly and for no reason, I was unable to easily insert the earphones into the player. With a little effort, I was finally able to insert the earphone, but could not get any sound.I contacted Sandisk and was very disappointed with their response. The player has a 1-year warranty but it's very apparent that Sandisk is attempting to discourage replacing defective products by making purchasers jump through hoops to test the product and prove it is defective rather than immediately fixing or replacing it. If the player won't work as advertised, why should I be inconvenienced as a result.In addition, a senior service person was supposed to contact me about the problem, but has not done so. I would never purchase a Sandisk product in the future -- too difficult to deal with if there's a warranty problem !"
1,"Sansa View 8 GB: This item is one of the worse I have seen in the Sansa family. I have had all the Sansa E200 series mp3 players and those froze at times when viewing video. Good sound when you use better headphones. The only thing that is good about this mp3 player is the large view screen. The conversion software always freezes after the video file has been converted meaning that you have to Ctrl<Alt<Delete to shut down the program. As a 'techie', I recommend that you don't buy this item. Oh! one more thing! Do not order via the free shipping that Amazon offers. It's just 'standard' meaning you could have you item delivered to you way past the scheduled mailing time or not at all. It's been a month now and I still haven't recieved my original order alhough Amazon was gracious to resend the item, but I had to get it sent to my job which amazingly got there much faster through the same type shipping. Imagine that!"
1,"This Item is a Piece of Junk!: I am thourghly disappointed in this Sansas View. It deleted songs all the time wont keep them on wont connect to computer, if it keeps them it puts them on 3 or 4 times and when you detelted the dups.it deletes them all."
1,"sent two back: IVE HAD TO SEND TWO OF THESE BACK NOW. THEY SHUT OFF AND WONT TURN BACK ON. THESE ARE DISCOUNTINUED AND I BELEIVE THE BATTERIES ARE SHOT IN THEM.I WOULDNT BUY ONE!!"
1,"Malfunction and battery doesn't last long: Got this about 6 weeks ago. One week into it, the device started getting ""stuck"" on rewind. It's supposed to stop rewinding when you release pressure on the wheel, which it still sometimes does successfully. About half the time, though, it gets stuck on rewind and the only thing I can do is turn it off, none of the other functions (like play or stop) work.Newer problem: it's supposed to skip to the next track when you hit the fast forward button twice. It did that in the beginning, now it usually doesn't, same thing with trying to go to a previous track.Either I got a lemon or this device is poor quality. This is my first MP3 player so I have no basis for comparison regarding battery life but it seems the battery drains very quickly."
1,"Not good: Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music."
1,"SanDisk MP3 Player: Player was defective. After charging battery, I turn it on and while attempting to download an audio-book, the unit ""locked up"", All functions ceased, and I couldn't turn it off: back of player became very warm. Battery finally lost life and the unit shut down. One unsuccessful attempt was was made to recharge it. It was returned for refund.."
1,"SECOND and LAST time around for Sandisk e series: This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."
1,"Hate this thing: I hate this thing. It worked for about a month and that is it. It has driver problems. After 5 hours on the phone with Rhapsody, 2 hrs. with Sansa it still does not work. I have downloaded everything for this. It does not work. Waste of money, time. Very disappointed."
1,"Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.: Sansaview 8 GB doesnt support 8GB external MicroSd card even with the latest F/W.When plugging an 8Gb external microsd all the media from sd card is displayed twice in Sansaview. Forums have reported this problem in 2008 and this issues is still not fixed by Sansa even in the latest F/W.If you connect a 4Gb micro SD this issue goes away.If we remove the multiple listing of same items, I would love this player.The play button automaticaly aligns for landscape photo/video view. After I upgraded to latest F/W could see most of the videos, the firmware which came alongwith SansaView 1.01 could only play audio without showing the videos.To get the device upgraded need to connect in MSC mode which is not visible from the settings and the trick is to keep the ""Previous"" button pressed in ""hold"" mode while connecting the cable to laptop."
2,"Great MP3 player!: This is a great MP3 player, and costs a lot less than an Apple equivalent. Shipping was fast. In case you want to sync some tracks from your computer to the Sansa View, connect it to your computer and call SanDisk support and they will ""activate"" the player remotely and you will be able to sync ever after. I downloaded to user manual. It is much more detailed than the skippy little guide that comes with the player. All in all I am very happy with this player."
1,"Its a Cheap MP3 Player thats it: Its just a durable product with great sound quality, but don't expect anything more from it. The ear phones are too big for my years and the device is not easy to use. You will need to use a software to convert your videos to be compatible with this device. The only good thing is that you don't need any software to load songs in to this player, however, the folders that you have on your hard disk will not appear on the player. This is what I don't like. I would like to have a player which will let me create my own music folders and not create the default ones. I disliked iPod because of iTunes, but now I feel iPod is much better than this even though iTunes is not so easy to use, its at least easier than running this device. No wonder, the product is priced so cheap."
1,"Good Product-when it lasted.: This was a pretty good product until the damn thing just stopped working and just froze up when you tried to turn it on. I had it just over a year and after turning it on the device just went into bootup mode, never actually coming on. As long as I had it, it would frequently exhibit the same behavior. The only thing that would help was to take out the battery out and back in. Finally in the end, that did not help at all.The durability of the Sansa's line is poor at best."
2,"Sansa GP3 Player is good for the value: My 13 year old son is very pleased with this product.The only problem I had with AMAZON is they marketed it on the screen with a protective skin and power cord to buy ""as a bundle"". Unfortunately, the skin that was shown on the screen did not fit. Not good, AMAZON!"
2,"Excelent product!: I definitely like this. All the features that has makes this product smooth and easy to operate.Definitely recommended."
1,"Horrible for long audio files: The player is awful if you are using it to listen to lectures; it only recognizes 25 minutes of an mp3. Plus, the fast forward function is EXTREMELY slow (to fast forward 10 mins would take about 3-4 minutes of holding down the button).Otherwise, it plays music fine, though the software on the mp3 player is no where near as nice as what you get with ipods (e.g. if you pull the headphones out of the jack it will pause the file, or it will remember the exact location in a file where you last left off instead of restarting a file if you turn the player off), but on the flip side it is also significantly cheaper.Overall, you get what you pay for."
1,"Sandisk 8 gig black: Bought two units and after a few months one stopped working. Could get no info from the unit it was dead. Contacted Sandisk and ask for quick replacement. Offered to prepay to secure item would be shipped quick. Was told I did not need this. Item was bad and would be replaced with in a few days. After waiting a full month, I had to phone the Co on Ca. Manager told me the order had not been shipped and this some times happens. Had phoned the supply house in another state and player would be shipped.Worse customer support I have seen. Would not buy another unit from this Co. Manager I talked with sounded like a brain dead stoner. Might be why orders get lost.Order with caution and if you require replacement, prepare to follow up daily."
1,"Did not work out of the box: I got the View for Christmas for my daughter after her Sansa Fuze died after several years of heavy use. It would never charge right out the box using both the USB or the electric charger I have for my own Fuse. I went online and tried everything the sandisk site said-nothing worked. Got the online chat who informed me that I had to use e-mail to resolve the issue since the View is a ""Legacy"" item. Sent an e-mail and never got a response. Their customer service department needs a lot... of help. On the plus side, sent it back to Amazon who gave A+++ refund service. Thanks Amazon!"
1,"Bad Luck?: The Sansa View 8GB I received was faulty. The battery would not hold a charge and/or the player would not turn on. This happened within hours of opening the player packaging and attempting an initial full-charge of the player's battery. The battery is only chargeable via USB and I tried using a PC and an AC to USB adapter to charge it. There is no hard reset button like I have seen on other players (namely Cowon brand players) so it could not simply be reset.I decided to return the product for a refund because it did not seem worth the trouble of waiting for a new (or repaired) player. I was not very impressed with the build quality of the player. It felt and looked very prone to scratching or other damage if not treated with extreme care. Furthermore, I found another player that suited my personal needs and desires better than the Sansa View."
2,"Good Player - Bad Tech Support: I had no end of trouble getting it installed on my Vista computer. Tech Support was useless, apparently not admitting to the problem. I finally tried the forums and found a workaround. Finally working, the player is great for music and my Audiobooks, small, easy to use, generally just what I wanted."
1,"Not Happy: I recently purchased a used 8 GB View. It works well as a 8 GB View but will not support an 32 GB SD card. The literature on the internet said that it would support a 32 GB card."
1,"ejects micro SD chip!: I was very happy with my Sansa View, until all of a sudden my micro SD chip was missing. I couldn't imagine someone stealing just a chip, but then when I tried to put a new one in, I noticed it would only be installed for a second or two before the spring inside the unit would expel the chip. It would actually launch it up 4-6 inches! So now I know my original chip is somewhere at the gym, certainly vacuumed up by now.It's a great player, but check to make sure your SD card doesn't come out too easily or just send it back!"
2,"One major criticism: Mostly very happy with this product, except the fact that it's dreadfully slow on fast forward or reverse. As you might imagine this can become very frustrating at times. And also totally unable to skip ahead to another part of the recording immediately similar to what the ipod can do.---C'mon Sandisk, give us some software to correct these serious inconveniences!!"
2,"Decent: Well, on the plus side it has great sound and good picture the ability to expand the memory and an FM radio(iPods don't have this feature). The downside it that the screen has a somewhat greasy look. This doesn't show very much during movies but it is a bit annoying. The screen scratches very easily so I would reccomend a case. When watching a movie, sometimes the whole thing freezes up and you have to turn it off and back on again. This is not horrible but it does get on your nerves after a while. The spin wheel is awesome ( I like it much better than the iPods because the spin wheel actually moves on the Sansa View). The whole thing is very easy to use and very user friendly. Overall this is a good product."
2,"He likes it!: I bought this as a gift for my husband and the more he uses it, the more he is thrilled with it. Only downside is the weight."
2,"Better than expected: THE SANSA VIEW IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. THE MUSIC SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD BUT LACKS BASS POWER. THE VIDEO PLAYER WORKS GREAT ONCE YOU FIND AN EASIER WAY THAN PROVIDED BY SANDISK. USING THEIR PROVIDED ""SANSA MEDIA CONVERTER"" WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THEIR WEBSITE TAKES HOURS TO CONVERT A MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW, BUT USING THE ""PSP MOVIE CONVERTER"" DOES THE JOB IN COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN DRAG AND DROP THE MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW USING RHAPSODY MEDIA PLAYER. ONCE I LEARNED TO DO THAT I BEGAN ENJOYING THE PLAYER. THE PICTURE VIEWER IS GREAT AS WELL. I ALSO OFFER THE FM RADIO FOR WHEN U WANNA HEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, DSEPERATE FOLDER FOR AUDIOBOOKS AND PODCAST, EXPANSION SLOT. A BANG FOR THE BUCK."
2,"Love My MP3: I love this tiny MP3 player. Very easy to use. If you do have any problems, their customer support is great. I had to download a driver to get it going and I also called about another problem. They talked me right through everything and it all works well. I bought it primarly for the purpose of using a speaker system with it so I can listen to music in my office instead of depending on the radio. The earphoes included were not the best, so I did purchase another pair for improved comfort. I have loaded a video and some photos on it as well as music. To add videos and pictures it is necessary to dowload free software from the Sansa site. I feel this is a great product and it was better than I expected with a very reasoable price."
2,"SANSA Sandisk 8 gb: I've had this product about 3 years now and use it everyday. I'm amazed at the quantity of music that I can put on it. I haven't used the video part of it, but, in a pinch have used it while DJing when my other equipment failed. I totally recommend this."
1,"Nice player except.....: Nice player except the microSD card fails to be recognized anymore. The problem isn't the card (I've tried several), it IS the Player. The disappointing machine just fails to recognize that it even has a card slot. The expansion card slot is meaningless. And what with an appalling 90-DAY WARRANTY, you can see Sansa has little faith in their own products. It is really to be looked at as disposable. Get it really, REALLY cheap, or get something else. The rest of the machine operates fine and it pretty reasonably intuitive. But....but, the expansion card issue is a massive, strange failure. I wouldn't recommend this (or perhaps any SanDisk product. This just SHOULD NOT happen."
1,"if only it could last: This was my first mp3 player so i didn't neccessarily want anything fancy, just something with a decent sized screen. It worked pretty good for about a year. Then it began to randomly turn off. Usually when this happened i could turn it back on within a few minutes but this too ceased happening. I've now had it close to a year and a half and it cannot hold a charge at all. This would be fine if I only wanted to listen to it while it was charging, however I prefer my mp3 player to be portable. Do not buy this unless you prefer temporary dependability out of your electronics."
1,"This device is the worst ever: if its not tranferring the wrong music... its freezing up.. or not liecening properly.. or the device itself sticks(dail to select with). this is my third sansa and will be my last"
1,"a Mac user: NOT at all friendly for a Mac user. The instructions are not at all helpful and tech services are not available on weekends."
1,"Save up and get a nano instead.: Whatever you do, avoid this product. I was lured by the lower price tag and as a group exercise instructor I needed something to lug all my music around on. I didn't want to lose my ipod (which I LOVE) so I got this instead.Well I've gone through two of them. You name the problem and I've had it. It has stopped working in the middle of a class I'm teaching, I've gotten the white screen of death, the display crapped out and for some reason it just stopped connecting to my computer. If I could give this zero stars I would. It will break if you look at it sideways.Sansa is replacing this for me, for the second time, but I'm going to buy another ipod instead because I just can't rely on this thing at all. I don't even think its worth giving to someone once the replacement gets here.DON'T BUY IT, YOU'LL REGRET IT!"
1,"De la poudre aux yeux: J'ai achet̩ un Sansa View 16gB pour $200 CAD il y a deux ans et demie �� peine, et la batterie vient de mourrir. L'estimation pour la r̩paration et le remplecement de la batteire est de $80 minimum, vous voyez le topo? Malgr̩ son excellente sonorit̩, je ne recommande pas cet appareil, difficile �� comprendre, parfois il g̬le... �� ̩viter!"
1,"Frustrating: Any problem listed in previous reviews, I encountered with mine. At which point I discovered one more weakness of this mp3 player.It does not fare well against a hammer."
1,"Bad battery - not replaceable - throw away unit: I recently received a refurbished View as a birthday gift, charged it up, set it down a couple of days. When I picked it up I found it was dead. I charged it again, called Sansa about the issue and they agreed it was a bad battery after diagnosing the problem. They also told me the battery is not replaceable and after warranty you throw these units away. Now I need to deal with Buy.com to see if they will give me my money back or replace the unit hopefully with a e200 series. The e200 series has inexpensive replaceable batteries."
1,"Great player, bad job with the refurbish: We bought this player for my mother, as I have the same one and love it. But, this player had problems from the get go, being a refurbished model. Sansa support was good, but their fix for the problem only lasted a matter of hours. We eventually had to return it, which was a fast and painless process with Amazon.The player, when it works correctly is great. I can't even begin to fill mine up with songs, videos and recordings. The FM recorder is great for lectures, conventions and other occasions. The sound quality is amazing. I also love that, unlike the e200 series you can format and also erase songs directly on the player without using your computer. It also conveniently has a spot for audiobooks and podcasts. Also to note that you can download shows and movies from amazon to play on this player.It was tough giving a star rating as this particular player was broken, but knowing from experience that they can make wonderful mp3 players."
2,"go with the view: I was upgrading from a Sandisk Sansa e280 4GB unit. This unit does a better job playing everything (audio and videos) and with a larger screen and longer battery life, I was sold. I think this unit is a great option if you want to avoid ipod and itunes."
1,"OK but lots of bugs which never get fixed!: I'm frustrated by things that never get fixed on this product. I use the Sansa View to listen to 1-hour mp3 recordings from a class I'm taking. If I pause the recording in the middle and resume later in the day (after the Sansa has powered down), the recording NEVER starts where I left it!!!!! The most frustrating thing is that I've reported this problem to SanDisk over 6 months ago and it is never addressed, even though my problem was acknowledged by their tech support.To further complicated things, the fast forward does not accelerate, so when I need to get back to the 30th minute of the recording, I have to hold down the fast-forward button for about five minutes. I also reported this problem over 6 months ago with the same result -- acknowledged by tech support but never addressed.With the amount of firmware updates they've made, this is clearly a product being beta tested on the customers."
2,"Great little mp3: I've had this mp3 player for a few months now and really like it. It's very lightweight, easy to use (I saw from the reviews here to format it before attempting to add music - that's the only thing that would've been unclear from the instructions), good sound quality. The battery really does last a long time if all you're doing is listening to music, which is mainly what I do. I'm very satisfied with my non-conformist (ie non-ipod) mp3 player! Saved myself a little money and don't look like everyone else out there."
1,"Battery problems: Worked fine... until the battery died after one year. You can't replace it so essentially the player is useless. Would not recommend."
1,"Poor Qiality Control: Despite the many reviews from folks who had to return one or more Sansa Views before getting a functional one, I figured the manufacturer must have cleared up their quality problems to stay in the market. Wrong!!!!My brand new Sansa View 8 totally stopped functioning about 20 minutes into its first use. I'm very disappointed to have waited for my order to be filled and now must wait again for a replacement. I'm more than a month into my purchase and I have nothing to show for it but a paid bill.Amazon has not stepped up at all, either. The order was filled by a vendor whom I've never heard of before. Amazon refers buyers to that vendor's customer service and takes no part in satisfying the purchaser.Lots of room for improvement on the part of all three providers."
1,"Less then one year, Issues already: I purchased this less then one year ago, already the buttons are less responsive. The biggest problem that I have is that it does not play the songs correctly any more. I can hear the music and sometimes the back round singing but not the main singing. This started out as a periodic problem as I was running but now is almost all the time.I am very disappointed in this player."
1,"I think I hate it: I had high expectations for this player. I have the Sandisk m240 and m250 and they have amazing sound quality so I thought, being from Sandisk, it would follow suit. It didn't. Very disappointed with the sound quality. It even breaks up. And forget about organizing you music and videos. You can't create folders on your own. Have to use Windows Media Player. And I still haven't figured out how to make video playlists. WMP won't accept mp4 files in the Video playlist. Plus, when scrolling through your library, the scroll wheel only goes forward so, if you want to play a song that begins with ""Y"" and don't what to start from ""A"" and scroll through 8GB WORTH OF SONGS all the way down to ""Y"" but want to scroll up from ""Z"" to ""Y"", you can't."
2,"Good value for the money: I purchased this mp3 player for my daughter who really likes it. She experienced some difficulty at first downloading her music, but this problem has been resolved.The player is very easy to use - she did not even need to read the manual."
1,"You get what you pay for: I bought this earlier this year, thinking I am getting an upgrade from my Sansa M250.Wish I was not soo quick to throw out my old player.Its really fustrating when it syncs with the computer after disconnecting it takes hours ( by then the battery is drained) to power off from the connected mode.I hate thisproduct. Get the real deal save yourself some fustration and money. Not worth it.Beware!"
1,"disappointed with this MP3: I purchased this MP3 player as a Christmas gift for our daughter only to find out on Christmas Day that is not compatible without our computer despite every update available. While we could see the preloaded video and it is very clear and bright, we were never able to upload any music. My husband (who is computer wizard) spent 12 hours trying to get this thing to work, but without any success. Next time we'll buy an IPod."
2,"Good Value for the Money: Pretty good value for the money. Prefer Zune's tactile interface. Not much information on how to install Videos, photos or Album Art. But should be able to figure it out from the internet. Try to keep it away from Cell phone, when I put my View in the same pocket as my cell phone it caused the View to lock up or shut down. Like the fact you can add memory with SD cards. Overall more positives than negatives."
1,"Has one important major flaw: Had no luck, even with latest firmware, getting the unit to resume any of my audio books. I tried changing the tags on the mp3 files but it did not work. The unit would go into auto shut off and then force you to start your audio book file from the start every time."
1,"Be nice if it worked.: Apart from arriving in nearly 2 pieces ( apart ) it did not work and the software did not work either. Going away in a week, so I cannot use it. Pissed off."
2,"A few kinks, but overall it works well: Unfortunately it hasn't been all wine and roses w/my View but overall I would say that I'm satisfied with it. After having to return my first view due to battery problems the second one I got has worked great. It has been reliable (so far) and it's a breeze to load w/my music, photos and short home videos. The sound is fine with a little tweaking and creating my own equalizer setting. The screen rotates to landscape to show videos so you get the widescreen view, albeit on a very small screen. The wheel works well to glide through the menu as well as volume control. It feels solid though definitely not noticeable on my arm when I'm working out."
2,"as good as an i-pod: well i had an rca 4108 was ok, but the headphone input circuit broke. so i went on a hunt looking for another. So i started to read reviews. this sansa was the best i've read and so far held up to it's reviews. I like it and would recomend it."
2,"Sansa e280: Can not beat this item for the price, hands down!Excellent product with all the features you could want, period."
2,"Wonderful device: I purchased this for my husband to load a recertification course on and study. He also has music on it and is enjoying it very much. It was a great price, especially for this much memory. And Amazon's service was great as usual."
2,"Sansa View ROCKS!!!!: I have had this Model Sansa View MP3 since it first came out in 2005-2006. It remains durable & in perfect working condition. I store music and pics on it and have never had any issues. I was my first and only MP3 player until I bought an iPhone this year (2011). However, I still use the Sansa View for the gym because it's light weight ( I also have the arm case that goes with it for working out). I highly recommend it if your are looking for a quality MP3 player. I purchase and download music from the web-sit it gives you at purchase and i also transfer music from my Windows Media Player on my PC. Too Cool!!!"
1,"Wow...: Alright so this thing really needs a warning label on it. ""WILL FREEZE WHEN TRYING TO SKIP SONGS"" This stupid contraption lead me in the end to just break it. It freezes up when I try and skip a song, I have to try and turn the damn thing off before I can even go to the main menu after I've used it for about a half hour. The battery life is great, really, but it's just not worth it when it's playing and it goes to the next song, but the screen says it's one minute into the last song previous it was playing. Basically, you can't skip the song if you wanted. Nice going Sansa, you made a piece of crap."
1,"Not What I Had Expected: I had hoped for a more from Sandisk. After about 10 very frustrating days of trying to get it to work properly, the unit stopped altogether. The expansion memory never did work. It would only duplicate what was on the internal memory. Sandisk support was polite and tried to be helpful. Unfortunately, we were not in any way successful in getting the unit to work. After I got the error message on my computer that the unit has malfunctioned and should be replaced, I sent it back.SanDisk Sansa View 8 GB Video MP3 Player (Black)"
1,"Plzz don't buy it: Review: I have had the sansa view 8gb for a year before the navightional wheel didnt work any more.(Make it fun! Who says you can't be informative and entertaining) I dont think so! im a person left musicless.( aawwww )Pros: the wheel lights up.Cons: the wheelConcluction: dont buy it!, dont !, wait one more time, DONT BUY IT !Recommendations: I personaly recommend buying an archos product, nuff said. :["
2,"flowerpots and spanish guitar: This is really a beautiful album. Micus plays all of the tracks by himself, on spanish guitar, zither, nay and flowerpots. The flowerpots are particularly interesting. They sound sort of like a marimba. The compositions are very interesting, and not at all sappy. I am sure micus cringes to see his music thrown in bins with world music and new age. It is not at all trite or commercialized. Some of the pieces include solo guitar, then some vibrant otherworldy rythmic flowerpot playing, back into solo guitar, generally quiet."
2,"The best book I've read on public speaking: As a member of Toastmasters I have access to a wide variety of materials and seminars on public speaking. However, this one book covered more material in less space and in easier terms than all the seminars I've attended. His style is not that of a college textbook - if it were I wouldn't have read it. His style is straight from the hip. I consider this book to be my textbook, with Toastmasters providing the chance to practice what I've read. This book has done more to improve my speeches than the formal Toastmaster's evaluations."
2,"Myth: Great speakers are born: Myth: Great speakers are born. Dale Carnegie's ""The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking"" may be a misnomer - it's not as easy as easy as the title may imply, but more importantly, he shows that it's nurture not nature that makes a great speaker. The book is filled with inspiring examples, tips and lessons. If you want to become a great speaker, this is a must read. You'll learn about the common pitfalls, the structure of the talk, the importance of introductions, conclusions, and much more. This book has stood the test of time and helped thousands of people, I'm glad to say that I'm one of them."
1,"public speaking book: I actually didn't finish this book. It had some good pointers within it but I felt it was doing more story telling than teaching me how to calm down and deliver a speech without my breakfest or lunch wanting to errupt. Although it was somewhat interesting it wasn't doing what I needed it to and that was to teach me not to want to disappear before I got up in front of a group of people."
1,"good examples - no index: Public speaking in narrative form. Lots of stories and examples from Lincoln to businessmen in 1969. Interesting to read. No index, not user-friendly as a resource."
1,"Carnegie Aint what he used to be...: Dale carnegie wrote very well in his earlier works, this later work (assumedly from later in his life, or judging from the text possibly written postumously) is the worst thing i have ever seen in print.As an english professor it seemed sardonic to me to see someone write so poorly about the topic of speaking well. Perhaps i should have read this garabage aloud instead."
2,"Book by Dale Carnegie: I read book Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking. It gave me practical skills to do my presentation in the right way. I defended my thesis on 29th of December 2010. Some professors said me, that it was interesting speech. The principle of effective learning is read and do as written. Moreover it allow me to raise my language skills in English, because this book is written in understandable way and I am Russian. Many thanks to author and people who produced this book. Danil from Tomsk, Siberia"
1,"Huh?: I get the idea to be clear and to the point. But this was outdated before it was written, a real basic book,kids should read it once"
1,"Returned it: This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad"
2,"Quick review on public speaking: If you can get past the setting of the book, it provides lots of helpful hints on presenting various subject. A very good read. I am planning on purchasing other books by this author."
2,"A must read for public speaking: Excellent book. This book has been in print for so many years and has tremendous credibility. Reads like a textbook. A person in business who communicates must read this book. I highly recommend."
1,"Not what you're thinking: I've read this book as well as Carnegie's 2 other books, How to Win Friends & Influence People as well as How to Stop Worrying & Start Living. This one was a let down after those two, which i highly recommend (even with the old school references).This book stated a lot of common sense but nothing that I found I could use in off-the-cuff talks. In fact it, discourages that. It's also a bit of a dry read.While I admire his other books, I did not like this one."
2,"Another Great Book by Dale Carnegie: I loved reading Dale Carnegie's books since I picked up How to Win Friends and Influence People. His writing style is very easy to read and he is always giving examples to make the content as clear as possible. That being said, The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking is a great book. I personally preferred How to Win Friends and Influence People over this book, so if you have not read that book, I would recommend reading it first. However, if you are specifically looking for a book on Public Speaking, Dale Carnegie is a great author and he has several books about this topic. This one is great and I recommend it."

2,"Great Player/Radio/USB drive, but...: I ordered this great little player as a birthday gift to myself. It's outstanding except for one problem - The firmware is the unit as shipped was buggy! In version 1.04.3, any interrupted transfer to the device causes it to malfunction!I looked up the Creative support forum and dozens of people reported the same problem, namely a complete lockup of the unit and subsequent inability to ""boot"" it...My first unit failed after about fifteen minutes of playing with it, loading files, etc. Needless to say, I was distressed. Turns out YOU MUST UPDATE THE FIRMWARE as soon as you get it recharged. Another point I must strongly emphasize is that YOU MUST ""EJECT"" THE DEVICE under Windows BEFORE DISCONNECTING IT.I'm happy to report that firmware version 1.05.1 is much better and that I have not ""crashed"" since updating to it. I'm really enjoying it!I love this product and would give it 5 stars were it not for the buggy firmware that shipped with it. Cheers!"
1,"Great at First, but......: My daughter received this item as a Christmas gift. About a month ago it just stopped working. We have had several emails and phone calls back and forth to the company, ""Creative"" is an accurate name for them...they are creative about honoring the 90 day warranty by putting you off until you are out of warranty. They have promised three times to email me the forms to have it fixed or replaced...and nothing yet. I emailed the company again today. They do not have a customer service number that is toll free, and I am about done running up my phone bill.We were happy with it for the first 60 days or so, but now, I will never buy another ""Creative"" product again, based on their customer service."
1,"Crashed within 3 hours of first use - needs new firmware !!: This POS started giving ""English font only"" and ""download new firmware from ""www.creative.com"" within 3 hours of using it after it was fully charger. Creative has NO firmware upgrade for this model since it is so new, and support cannot help. Search for ""rhomba firmware"" at google and visit Creative's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they cannot recover from at all. People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it. *sigh* another bug-ridden thing from Creative. Going back for the iPod 10GB - $100 upgrade, but I am sure I will have NO problems making that thing work since it is an Apple."
1,"Watch Out!!!: I received my new Rhomba, and was all excited to open it and try it out. I open it and go through the quick setup guide and plug it into a USB port on my pc so it can charge up. As I am waiting for the unit to charge I start reading through the manual and come across the following message... The cables that come with this unit contain LEAD which has been shown to cause CANCER and it is strongly suggested that you wash your hands after every time you touch them....Say What???!!!! I fired off an email to Creative asking them to provide a little more clarity on this statement with no response. Needless to say I am returning the unit."
2,"SD: just for the record: last day off my vacation in mexico and i dived into the Carraibean with my digital camera into my pocket :) (don't ask why) and althogh the camera is now mearly scrap (pentax optio s) the memory card works fine and i didn't lost any of my vacation photos with would have been a lot worse - so SD cards are water proof and salt water proof :)"
1,"Fragile: This is a cute little gadget, but it got broken after only three months of carrying it in my pocket. Seems to be too fragile for being a mobile player."
1,"Cheaply made, NOT reliable: The Rhomba is cheaply made. Mine stopped working completely after about two months. Piece of garbage."
1,"Creative could be creative: I bought this player for my nephew(age15) one year ago. After the first month it wouldn't work. called and they refused a new one, only rebuilt. OK. Sent it back and 4 1/2 months later it stopped playing again. They refused him any replacement, partial payment to fix it, no solution to the problem. I am sitting here with this $179.MP3 player that doesn't work, that I can now get for $119 and am not sure what to do with it. Do I throw it away, can it be fixed(again). I would not buy any Creative product again. EVER"
1,"Don't buy this Product !!!!: I read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet."
1,"A product with error.: The first day I bought this, it didn't work. But then the next day, it worked a gain. I continued to use it for 1 month, and it didn't work completely. Many people used it and said that it is a bad product with errors."
1,"Creative Rhomba = Big Headache: After carefully opening the player, reading the entire instruction manual and following it to the letter, the player froze up. I can not accurately describe my anger. I bought this thing because reviews said it was the most customer friendly. If it didn't cost me $125, I would have run it over with my car. Do yourself a favor, avoid the Rhomba at all costs."

1,"One of the Worst Books I've Ever Read, Don't Waste Your Time: I was so excited to see a new book on Frederick Douglass I didn't take time to preview the book. A classic mistake. The book is full of assumptions and innuendo. It seems the author was trying to destroy Frederick Douglass' place in history. There were too many insulting statements based on little or no fact. I tried to keep an open mind while reading the book, but the more I read the more disgusted I became. What the author may consider conservative and controversial; I consider a racist piece of trash."
1,"Big Dropoff: There is a huge dropoff in quality from Vol 1. of the Whistle Test clips to this package, simply because there is a huge dropoff in the quality of the artists between the two volumes. Sorry, but Loggins and Messina, Average White Band, Jim Croce, Hall & Oates, Thomas Dolby and Simply Red just don't match up to Bill Withers, Captain Beefheart, Talking Heads, XTC, Iggy Pop and the Specials. The commentary from the show's hosts and the various musicians is still enjoyable and enlightening, as on the first collection, and this whole volume is almost made worthwhile simply for the stunning clip of the sublime Judee Sill sitting at the piano and painfully/beautifully singing her majestic ballad. And Jools Holland is a lot of laughs, both when talking about the Squeeze clip that is included and in the clip itself. So there's some nice moments here, but I really don't want to own anything that includes Loggins and Messina on it."
1,"Not a good followup...: The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted some incredibly groundbreaking FULL CONCERTS, two of which were the original Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Return To Forever (performing most of Romantic Warrior). Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers."
2,"bargain blues, McShann style: What a deal. A nice collection of 40's small band blues and swing by McShann and friends. A great introduction to the world of McShann."
2,"EXCELLANT SHADE: Highly recommended, I find this canopy durable, an ease to install, and made of high quality construction. For the past 3 years, I have rented similar type canopies for my summer B.B.Q.'s. These rentals exceeded over $300.00 per occasion. Now, I can enjoy this canopy and at the same time save hundreds of dollars on the rental fee's."
2,"Great results. I'm going to start up again: Over the winter, i seem to gain alot of weight. As a high school quarterback, that is not acceptable. Last summer, i think i went from 160 to 150. That's my gross weight loss. I'm not even talking about how much fat i lost. I gained a good amount of muscle over the summer, so i probably lost over 15 lbs of fat. I got my six pack back, and life was great. After the season, i just quit, and now my six pack is back in the fridge. I'll probably order some up next week and start again. These are great, and the results are amazing."
1,"Disappointed that I wasted my money: After reading all the great reviews on this product on Amazon, I decided to go for this. I don't typically have good results from diet products, but I figured I'd give it a shot. I've been taking these for 3 weeks, as directed, and I might as well have been taking sugar pills for all the more this is doing for me. I felt like my appetite increased, I haven't lost any weight at all - in fact I've been fluctuating up and down 3 pounds for the past couple of weeks. I gave this two stars because I didn't feel the anxiety or sleeplessness that some people complained about, but I'm still disappointed. I was hoping I'd find something that actually worked!"
1,"Green Tea: Well, it arrived on time and in OK condition, but after almost a month of taking it, I haven't noticed any change, except now I have stomach cramps."
2,"This is Great! Get Real...: Okay, let's face it, it's all about time and there's just too little of it. With this cookbook, not only can you recapture some of that time but you can also serve up some absolutely scrumptious meals and snacks. I know the purists all rave about the use of packaged prepared foods, but come on, who today has time to cook from scratch? Statistics prove that fewer people cook from scratch and get bland, pedestrian fast food, with Semi Homemade Cooking anyone can be a ten minute maestro of the kitchen."
1,"Not at all good: This book is filled with recipes using brand-name adulterated products that contain large amounts of additives, preservatives, artificial flavors, colors, trans-fats, bland flavors and also cost a lot more then scratch foods.If you believe boiling potatoes, using fresh vegetables or measuring flour unthinkable, by all means this book is right up your alley...."
1,"Rip OFF!: Sandra Lee is a rip-off! I really like to cook - I read lots of cooking magazines and watch lots of cooking shows and Sandra Lee is so lame. Her recipes are not recipes at all, she just tells you to buy things and heat them up! One of her ""creations"", the kids cupcakes, were on the cover of an issue of ""Gourmet"" several years ago! I'm all for easy recipes but hers are not worthy of my time! She is a queen of velveeta processed, hydrogenated mediocrity! Don't waste your money. Just go to the velveeta website - the recipes are free there."
2,"Love it, Love it, LOVE IT: So many great looking, great tasing recipes. Fantastic for us working women who want to put a good meal on the table but have such little time. I've bought her second book too. And I'm buying a set for my nephew and his finance."
1,"Trailer Home Cooking, or How I Stopped Worrying and Learned to Love the Recipes on the Back of Pre-Packaged and Canned Garbage: Why, why, why? This woman is a talentless hack. I've seen better recipes on the back of soup cans! Sandra Lee's approach to inspired cooking is to add a can of tomatos to your Hamburger Helper! Woo! Seriously, though, this is a joke. I have nothing against easy cooking, but this is an absolute waste of time and money."
1,"Semi- additive Cooking: Very disappointing The recipes are filled with unhealthy ingredients .The concept is great but the nutritional benefits are not there-- so it isnt a quick fix for me.Hard to imagine Wolfgang endorsing such a book"
1,"Barely edible: I am all for shortcuts in the kitchen and I am not a health nut or a food snob, but I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of recipes in this book that were edible. Most of them were seriously lacking in the flavor department. The fact that most of them are very poor, nutrition-wise, also concerned me a lot. She seems beholden to too many ingredients that are high in fat and sodium, as well as chemicals and preservatives. I mean, why use artificial coffee creamer in an eggnog recipe? I received this book as a gift, from a well-meaning friend. I would have much rather gotten one of rachel Ray's books, as she really knows how to make fast and simple meals from fresh ingredients."
2,"Don't be fooled by these books,: just because the recipe says to use pre-made ingredients doesn't mean you can't take the extra time to make as many of them from scratch that you can, like shredding your own cheese, cutting up a onion, or making your own mashed potatoes, etc. I sub as many fresh ingredients as I can for the pre-packaged and I still have a good meal made in no time. That may defeat the purpose of the cookbook, BUT, the recipes are what stand out, and any can me made with fresh or pre-packaged items.They are good, everyday family meals. The photos and lay out are outstanding, and the books are well priced for the quality we get from them. Worth the money."
1,"Rip Off of previous Book: I'm so mad! I got this supposedly ""new"" Cookbook and when it came it looked identicall to the first cookbook expcept her picture on the front is different! I bought the same book from Sandra Lee 2 years ago!! Same damn pictures and same damn recipes are in this ""new"" Cookbook! Don't waste your money I'm returning mine today!"
1,"Call the doctor!: Once again, Sandra Lee is out to poison America with her high-sodium, preservative-laden recipes. This book is a joke. Under no circumstances should anyone who prefers not to die before the age of 45 should buy this. Heart attack city! Oh, and crappy food. Did I mention how bad her recipes are? Terrible. The scourge must be stopped! Whoot!"
2,"Producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time: Semi-Homemade Cooking introduces the idea of producing foods which seem time-consuming but only take a fraction of the time. How? By blending 70% store-bought ingredients with 30% fresh foods to produce the taste of homemade. Open with a Raspberry Sake, move to a Crabby Bisque of condensed crab bisque enhanced with heavy cream and crabmeat, then use the slow cooker to produce Chinese Braised Short Ribs or Southern Pulled Pork - or top it off with Cinnamon Buns made from frozen white bread dough enhanced with spices, sugar, and butter."
1,"Not a practical book: This oversized book does not lie flat unless you are using a recipe from the center pages. I tried cans and a rolling pin to weigh down the pages and nothing worked. The money spent on the endless photographs (do we really need to see a photo of empty cd boxes?)and the pre paid reply postcard ... would have been better spent on a smaller hard covered book that would be easier for home cooks to use...."
1,"Do Not Buy This Book: I do not think I am exagerating when I write that this woman has created an empire in which she is enabling people to become seriously overweight and possible worse health problems. This woman adds fat, additives, and perservatives when there is not need at all. For example, she adds mayonnaise to store bought salad dressing, basically for no reason. But most of all, she is advocating that packaged foods are the way to go. That is simply not good. The human body is meant meant to take in the amounts of chemicals that are contained in her recipes. Check the labels; if you see chemicals, don't eat it! If you care about your health, you will stay clear of Sandra Lee."
2,"What took me so long?!: Why did I wait so long to get this book I had heard so much about??? It is fantastic - so quick, great recipes, great photography....and easy to make your dish look like the photo!"
1,"Advertising: It is one brand name after another, don't waste your money.<br />This book has more fluff then recipes that you can use everyday, plus it will not save you money with all the package and can food you have to search out and buy."
1,"Outdated already!: I went to two stores trying to find the exact brand name products that Sandra Lee insist we use. Frustrated, I asked the store mananger who told me that the products I was looking for, Campbell's fat-free mushroom soup and Jello refrigerated vanilla pudding cups are no longer available in my area.Why make such a big fuss about using this or that brand when they aren't even available? I won't waste any more time travelling around town looking for the exact brand names needed to make the recipes in this book.I have better things to do! Maybe this book needs a ""use-by "" date before even more products become obsolete."
1,"WHAT is the point of this show???: Sandra Lee has nerve calling what she does ""cooking."" Putting together a bunch of boxed ""ingredients"" and dumping them into different bowls is not ""cooking."" Too bad we aren't seeing professional chefs cut down Lee with the same ferocity they do with Rachael Ray.I get nauseous just thinking about the amount of sodium and everything else that's in all those bags of packaged food that she uses (and why all the mixed drinks? Maybe Lee can put together a show about how to make mixed drinks - alcoholic and non-alcoholic - because she seems to know all about them).To think she follows Ina Garten (who can actually cook) Monday-Thursday, is indicative of the fact that The Food Network doesn't have a whole lot of requirements as to who gets a show on their channel."
2,"Help for the holidays: With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this book I knew it was just what I needed. Some of the recipes are fairly basic, like the lasagna, but there are other more exotic dishes that I can't wait to try, the shangra la lobster being one. I tested some of the appetizer and dessert recipes for holiday parties and they were easy easy easy and looked and tasted amazing. This is a terrific resource for the holidays and all year."
2,"A must read: Both sad and hilarious at the same time, this book is a must read for anyone who wonders at our current criminal justice policy. Almost four decades of the drug war have produced no discernable reduction in drug use, but loads of folks in prison and a steady erosion of our constitutional rights."
2,"quarter through, and totally imressed: I have yet to complete this book, but its great so far. Entertaining, and educational. hard to mix the two and keep my interests. I hope this helps sway you to purchase. HAPPY SHOPPING"
1,"Disappointing: The music plays just fine but the on screen picture is horrible. The picture is blurry and it looks like graphics form the 60's."
2,"A quick read....: .......with basic factual info. A must have if you were recently diagnosed with partial seizures."
2,"A MUST READ FOR ANYONE INTERESTED IN TRUE CRIME!! RIVETING!!: Last year I found this book and once I opened it I could not put it down. Bugliosi is excellent at bringing the details to life on the page. Not only do we get a first hand account of the trial, but he also explains much of the legal process in very clear and understandable terminology. I am now a fan of his work and will be reading everything I can of his."
2,"Sheer madness, meticulously documented: Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called ""Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It."" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read."
2,"The weirdest plot ever and it's all true.: I remember last year around Halloween I read an article about the best books to read for Halloween. Even the article's author conseded that this was a strange choice (it's not fiction) but had a good point. The first 10 pages of this book are truly terrifying and I guarantee you will be affected. It is also very hard because you can't help but feel desperate for the victims because terror was a part of what these killers meant to put into their last moments of life. And as most who know about this case it was one of the most horrible crime scenes to ever be discovered."
2,"the most exciting book i've ever read. i loved it!!!!!!: I thought this book was magnificent. The way Vincent Bugliosi described everything in such depth. I found some of it to be dragging in the beginning, but am I glad I didn't give up on this one. The chilling reality is what got to me the most."
2,"This Book Will Scare The Hell Out Of You: Vincent Bugliosi isn't kidding when he writes on the very first page ""The Story You Are About To Read Will Scare The Hell Out Of You"". Bugliosi somehow finds a way into the sick and distorted mind of Charles Manson, as he was the prosecutor during Manson's trial. He remembers small details from long ago, never moving over to another topic. ""Helter Skelter"" is a great albeit terrifying book."
